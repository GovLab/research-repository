- abstract: 'This report is the culmination of a year-long study of the users of mySociety
    websites. The study

    was conducted by researchers at the University of Manchester as part of an Economic
    and Social

    Research Council funded grant project. The main goal of the study was to better
    understand how

    individuals use and can benefit from four main mySociety sites in terms of resolving
    personal,

    community or wider societal issues and problems. A key supporting aim was to develop
    a

    transparent and replicable set of tools for measuring the impact of these sites
    that would help to

    develop a ‘best practice’ for mySociety and other ‘e-democracy’ organizations
    in evaluating their

    societal impact. The report provides a summary of the work we undertook, including
    a

    description of its wider social and academic significance and the key findings
    we produced. It also

    presents detailed description of how we conducted the research and the innovative
    combination

    of methodologies that were used to answer the central questions posed. '

- abstract: The growth and globalization of the Internet over the past 40 years has
    been nothing short of remarkable. Virtually all sectors, from development to healthcare
    to education to politics, have been transformed. Yet developments in how the Internet
    is governed have not kept pace with this rapid technological innovation. Figuring
    out how to evolve the Internet’s governance in ways that are effective and legitimate
    is essential to ensure its continued potential. Flexible and innovative decision-making
    mechanisms are needed in order to enable disparate governance actors to address
    and respond effectively as changes in the network occur. This paper seeks to address
    the need to develop an effective and legitimate Internet governance ecosystem
    by proposing a distributed yet coordinated framework that can accommodate a plurality
    of existing and emerging decision-making approaches. It draws on the lessons of
    open governance, adopting innovative techniques to facilitate coordination, information
    sharing, and evidence generation by and across increasingly diverse and global
    groups of Internet actors, and calls for creating practical tools to support such
    an effective, legitimate and evolving Internet governance ecosystem. Although
    no right answer or single model for how to manage all issues of relevance to the
    Internet is suggested within this paper, the proposed framework intends to allow
    for diverse experiments in distributed governance approaches to learn what works
    and what does not.

- abstract: Does online voting mobilize citizens who otherwise would not participate?
    During the annual participatory budgeting vote in the southern state of Rio Grande
    do Sul in Brazil -- the world's largest -- Internet voters were asked whether
    they would have participated had there not been an online voting option (i-voting).
    The study documents an 8.2 percent increase in total turn-out with the introduction
    of i-voting. In support of the mobilization hypothesis, unique survey data show
    that i-voting is mainly used by new participants rather than just for convenience
    by those who were already mobilized. The study also finds that age, gender, income,
    education, and social media usage are significant predictors of being online-only
    voters. Technology appears more likely to engage people who are younger, male,
    of higher income and educational attainment, and more frequent social media users.

- abstract: What effect does government responsiveness have on political participation?
    Since the 1940s political scientists have used attitudinal measures of perceived
    efficacy to explain participation. More recent work has focused on underlying
    genetic factors that condition citizen engagement. We develop a ‘Calculus of Participation’
    that incorporates objective efficacy – the extent to which an individual’s participation
    actually has an impact – and test the model against behavioral data from FixMyStreet.com
    (n=399,364). We find that a successful first experience using FixMyStreet.com
    (e.g., reporting a pothole and having it fixed) is associated with a 54 percent
    increase in the probability of an individual submit-ting a second report. We also
    show that the experience of government responsiveness to the first report submitted
    has predictive power over all future report submissions. The findings highlight
    the importance of government responsiveness for fostering an active citizenry,
    while demonstrating the value of incidentally collected data to examine participatory
    behavior at the individual level.

- abstract: One essential element of open data ecosystems concerns their development
    through feedback loops, discussions and dynamic supplier and user interactions.
    These user-centric features communicate the users’ needs to the open data community
    as well to the public sector bodies responsible for data publication. Addressing
    these needs by the corresponding public sector bodies or even by utilising the
    power of the community as ENGAGE supports will actually accelerate innovation.
    However, these elements appear barely to be part of existing open data practices.
    We conducted a survey which showed that most professional open data users did
    not know at least one open data infrastructure that enabled five specific types
    of discussion and feedback mechanisms. The survey showed that much can still be
    done to improve feedback and discussion on open data infrastructures. In this
    paper we discuss an open data platform which has started to contribute to filling
    this gap and present a usage scenario explaining the sequence of the underlined
    functionality. The discussed ENGAGE open data infrastructure combines functionalities
    to close the feedback loop and to return information to public authorities for
    better open data use and publication as well as establishing communication channels
    between stakeholders. This may effectively lead to the stimulation and facilitation
    of value generation from open data, as such functionality position the user at
    the centre of the open data publication process.

- abstract: 'In 2008 the first Swiss canton introduced internet voting for expatriates,
    thus initiating the second phase in Switzerland’s piecemeal i-voting roll-out.
    More cantons soon followed, and as of this writing expatriates from 12 out of
    the 26 cantons can vote online. This paper focuses on the second phase involving
    expatriates. We address three questions at the core of the internet voting research
    agenda. First, the popularity question: to what extent do expatriates make use
    of the new online channel? Second, the ‘who’ question: what is the profile of
    the typical expatriate i-voter? Finally, the turnout question: did the extension
    of internet voting to the expatriates have an effect on electoral mobilization?
    Our findings indicate that the online channel is very popular among expatriates,
    both if compared to other trials in Switzerland itself and internationally. On
    the other hand, known patterns regarding the profile of i-voters and the effect
    on mobilization seem to be also replicated in the expatriate trials. Expatriate
    i-voters tend to be young, male, and there is some evidence of an upper-class
    bias. Thus, usage of the online channel seems driven by the digital divide also
    among expatriates. Moreover, we find some evidence that i-voting did not affect
    electoral mobilization, similarly to trials involving residents.'

- abstract: The objective of this article is to highlight the contribution and importance
    of parliamentary information visualization (PIV) with a view to legislative transparency
    and citizen empowerment. The constant appeal for parliamentary openness regarding
    information on laws and bills and accountability of elected representatives calls
    for transparency in parliamentary procedures and at several areas of parliamentary
    informatics, in order to enhance democratic control and re-establish constituents’
    trust. On the other hand, the provision of easy to understand and analyze information
    plays a central role to the achievement of transparency. In this respect, this
    paper provides an overview of the characteristics and capabilities of information
    visualization that can contribute to delineating the institutional, but also technical
    possibilities and constraints of achieving legislative transparency. On the basis
    of this overview, it is attempted to highlight some causal relationships between
    parliamentary openness, legislative transparency and parliamentary information
    visualization, and discuss the potential and limitations of PIV not only in terms
    of technical solutions but also with respect to human factors and political aspects
    that need to be considered as further determining the success or failure of PIV
    efforts. In this line of thought, the concluding section of the article provides
    a discussion on the strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats that can be
    identified for parliamentary information visualization, as well as on dimensions
    and specific checkpoints that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of PIV
    efforts, as regards the end objective of citizen empowerment.

- abstract: 'Nowadays, involving citizens in Local Environmental Governance (LEG)
    is becoming increasingly important. In order to empower the role of citizen in
    this context, we propose an approach that relies on the establishment of a physical
    and intellectual space for shared understanding and collaboration between all
    stakeholders impacted by an environmental problem (in our case odour emission).
    Based on the development of an Information Technology (IT) system allowing odour
    emission measurement as well as the collection of citizen feedback, a Living Lab
    (LL) approach is being implemented that involves citizens, public authorities,
    industry and environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs). According to
    the definition of the European commission, Living Labs are “open innovation environments
    in real-life settings, in which userdriven innovation is fully integrated within
    the co-creation process of new services, products and societal infrastructures”.
    Based on this definition and considering, in our case, citizens as one of the
    end-users of the IT system, we argue that such an approach will empower their
    role in local environmental governance. This article presents the method and techniques
    that will be used in order to set up such a Living Lab. More precisely, we focus
    here on the first step of this method: defining the components that will support
    the management of a Living Lab relying on an IT system. This step consists in
    the identification of the Living Lab stakeholders (citizen, industry, public authorities,
    NGOs, etc.), including their characteristics, fears, expectations, involvement
    and engagement regarding the Living Lab. To do this, 2 main approaches are being
    combined: A Living Lab approach that aims to involve citizens in local Environmental
    Governance (LEG) design. Use of Human-Centred Design (HCD), to combine IT developments
    and LL needs, for example Personas methodology and usability test. A Living Lab
    relies mainly on stakeholders’ involvement in order to build trust and establish
    a common goal. In this sense, sociologists’ approaches ((Akrich et al. 2006);)
    bring valuable information on how to mobilise different actors in order to innovate
    (Actor Network Theory). However, in the innovation process, these approaches are
    only considering human actors and do not take into account any technological aspects.
    However, if Living Labs are relying on human actors’ interactions it should also
    take into account their interactions with the IT system it is based on. In this
    case, HumanCentred Design (HCD) being an approach that aims to make IT systems
    usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, is to
    be considered as complementary to the sociologists approaches. This article, based
    on the work performed in the FP7 European project OMNISCIENTIS, presents the theoretical
    context in which this study takes place as well as the overall methodology.'

- abstract: 'Over the last three years, the Boston Mayor''s Office of New Urban Mechanics,
    the innovative, collaborative ethos within City Hall fostered by Mayor Menino
    and his current chief of staff, Mitchell Weiss, and Boston''s launch of a CRM
    system and its associated Citizens Connect smartphone app have all attracted substantial
    media attention. In particular, the City of Boston''s strategy to put citizen
    engagement and participation at the center of its efforts, implemented by Chris
    Osgood and Nigel Jacob as co-chairs of the Mayor''s Office of New Urban Mechanics,
    has drawn attention to the potential power of collaboration and technology to
    transform citizens'' connections to their government and to each other. Several
    global developments have combined to make Boston''s collaborative efforts interesting:
    First, city managers around the world confront shrinking budgets and diminishing
    trust in the role of government; second, civic entrepreneurs and technology innovators
    are pressuring local governments to adopt new forms of engagement with citizens;
    and third, new digital tools are emerging that can help make city services both
    more visible and more effective. Boston''s experience in pursuing partnerships
    that facilitate opportunities for engaging citizens may provide scalable (and
    disruptive) lessons for other cities.


    During the summer of 2013, in anticipation of Mayor Menino''s retirement in January
    2014, Prof. Susan Crawford and Project Assistant Dana Walters carried out a case
    study examining the ongoing evolution of the Boston Mayor''s Hotline into a platform
    for civic engagement. We chose this CRM focus because the initial development
    of the system provides a concrete example of how leaders in government can connect
    to local partners and citizens. In the course of this research, we interviewed
    21 city employees and several of their partners outside government, and gathered
    data about the use of the system. (Exhibit A is a list of interviewees.)


    We found a traditional technology story — selection and integration of CRM software,
    initial performance management using that software, development of ancillary channels
    of communication, initial patterns of adoption and use — that reflects the commitment
    of Mayor Menino to personalized constituent service. We also found that that commitment,
    his long tenure, and the particular personalities of the people on the New Urban
    Mechanics team make this both a cultural story as well as a technology story.
    Here are the highlights: The combination of Mitchell Weiss''s vision for citizen
    engagement, Nigel Jacob''s expertise in software development and digital strategy,
    Chris Osgood''s experience in navigating government bureaucracy, and Bill Oates''s
    (CIO) private-sector experience has allowed this team to launch successful projects
    and build valuable partnerships that focus on citizen-centered innovation; Even
    without budgetary authority or staff, the innovation office within the Mayor''s
    suite (the Office of New Urban Mechanics) has been able to nudge, encourage, and
    facilitate collaborations inside City Hall and across academic institutions, technologists,
    and other city governments that have been productive; As one example of the team''s
    joint efforts and partnerships, both inside and outside City Hall, the launch
    of Boston''s Lagan CRM system in October 2008 was followed by integration of the
    system into the operations of several constituent-facing service departments;
    The system has evolved over time to include, among other things, a mobile app
    for field workers in the Department of Public Works (City Worker), a smartphone
    app for citizens (Citizen Connect), reports that are useful for performance management,
    and several different channels through which citizens can interact with City Hall,
    while retaining its high-touch, personalized character; Although every CRM system
    case is assigned a case ID number, the CRM system as a whole does not automatically
    assign a unique identifier to citizens that would allow uniform tracking across
    different modes of contact (smartphone app, Web interface, phone call) or mapping
    of particular citizens to particular neighborhoods. Constituents who contact the
    system may voluntarily provide contact details (name, home address, email, and
    phone); Future versions of this system, and layering of CRM data over other City
    data (911, inspections, sensor data, social sentiment data, traffic data), could
    make possible much more extensive citizen collaboration, situation awareness,
    policy inputs, performance analysis, and co-creation of government services or
    policies. Although there are many channels for reporting into the CRM system —
    Citizens Connect, SMS, web chat, phone calls — all of the people reporting in
    are not connected to each other, and the lack of unique identifiers makes true
    "citizen relationship management" difficult. Customer satisfaction is also not
    measured by the system, as far as we can tell. Outbound calls, texting, and Twitter/social
    media sentiment mining might be useful tools for this assessment; Combining formal
    CRM requests with social sentiment information could provide useful guidance underpinning
    policy decisions and resource allocation. Connecting all of this information to
    job functions within City Hall would also clearly be productive. And if we believe
    that people in their communities know more about their communities than all the
    gifted people in City Hall, how do we enable them to help themselves solve some
    of their own problems? Boston City Hall has not been focused on predictive analytics
    or the public release of data; rather, the team''s top priorities (in line with
    Mayor Menino''s strategy) have been to improve service delivery and encourage
    citizen engagement; Mayor Menino''s leadership style, strategic goals, and long
    tenure, together with the particular personalities of the members of the core
    team profiled in this study, have been essential to this narrative; The longterm
    effects on either the operation of City government or citizen engagement of the
    Office of New Urban Mechanics and the innovative, experimental ethos encouraged
    by that Office, Chief of Staff Mitchell Weiss, and CIO Bill Oates are unclear.
    Much will depend on the character and priorities of the new mayor.'

- abstract: Scientific studies investigating laws and regularities of human behavior
    are nowadays increasingly relying on the wealth of widely available digital information
    produced by human social activity. In this paper we leverage big data created
    by three different aspects of human activity (i.e., bank card transactions, geotagged
    photographs and tweets) in Spain for quantifying city attractiveness for the foreign
    visitors. An important finding of this papers is a strong superlinear scaling
    of city attractiveness with its population size. The observed scaling exponent
    stays nearly the same for different ways of defining cities and for different
    data sources, emphasizing the robustness of our finding. Temporal variation of
    the scaling exponent is also considered in order to reveal seasonal patterns in
    the attractiveness.

- abstract: A bottom-up approach to smart cities places citizens in an active role
    of contributing, analysing and interpreting data in pursuit of tackling local
    urban challenges and building a more sustainable future city. This vision can
    only be realised if citizens have sufficient data literacy skills and experience
    of large, complex, messy, ever expanding data sets. Schools typically focus on
    teaching data handling skills using small, personally collected data sets obtained
    through scientific experimentation, leading to a gap between what is being taught
    and what will be needed as big data and analytics become more prevalent. This
    paper proposes an approach to teaching data literacy in the context of urban innovation
    tasks, using an idea of Urban Data Games. These are supported by a set of training
    data and resources that will be used in school trials for exploring the problems
    people have when dealing with large data and trialling novel approaches for teaching
    data literacy.

- abstract: Could social media data aid in disaster response and damage assessment?
    Countries face both an increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters
    due to climate change. And during such events, citizens are turning to social
    media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social media
    improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency information,
    enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief efforts. Additionally,
    spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages helps with real-time
    monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. Here we present a multiscale
    analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We examine
    the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the United States and find a strong
    relationship between proximity to Sandy’s path and hurricanerelated social media
    activity. We show that real and perceived threats – together with the physical
    disaster effects – are directly observable through the intensity and composition
    of Twitter’s message stream. We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly
    correlates with the per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. Our
    findings suggest that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment
    (“nowcasting”) of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.

- abstract: Social media use has become increasingly popular among police forces.
    The literature suggests that social media use can increase perceived police legitimacy
    by enabling transparency and participation. Employing data from a large and representative
    survey of Dutch citizens (N = 4,492), this article tests whether and how social
    media use aﬀects perceived legitimacy for a major social media platform, Twitter.
    A negligible number of citizens engage online with the police, and thus the ﬁ
    ndings reveal no positive relationship between participation and perceived legitimacy.
    The article shows that by enhancing transparency, Twitter does increase perceived
    police legitimacy, albeit to a limited extent. Subsequent analysis of the mechanism
    shows both an aﬀective and a cognitive path from social media use to legitimacy.
    Overall, the ﬁndings suggest that establishing a direct channel with citizens
    and using it to communicate successes does help the police strengthen their legitimacy,
    but only slightly and for a small group of interested citizens.

- abstract: 'Transparency’s importance as an administrative norm seems self-evident.
    Prevailing ideals of political theory stipulate that the more visible government
    is, the more democratic, accountable, and legitimate it appears. The disclosure
    of state information consistently disappoints, however: there is never enough
    of it, while it often seems not to produce a truer democracy, a more accountable
    state, better policies, and a more contented populace. This gap between theory
    and practice suggests that the theoretical assumptions that provide the basis
    for transparency are wrong. This article argues that transparency is best understood
    as a theory of communication that excessively simplifies and thus is blind to
    the complexities of the contemporary state, government information, and the public.
    Taking them fully into account, the article argues, should lead us to question
    the state’s ability to control information, which in turn should make us question
    not only the improbability of the state making itself visible, but also the improbability
    of the state keeping itself secret.'

- abstract: 'The interaction between barriers to data sharing in public health is
    complex, and single solutions to single barriers are unlikely to be successful.
    Political, economic and legal obstacles will be the most challenging to overcome.


    Public health data sharing occurs extensively as a collection of subregional and
    regional surveillance networks. These existing networks have often arisen as a
    consequence of a specific local public health crisis, and should be integrated
    into any global framework.


    Data sharing in public health is successful when a perceived need is addressed,
    and the social, political and cultural context is taken into account.


    A global data sharing legal framework is unlikely to be successful. A global data
    governance or ethical framework, supplemented by local memoranda of understanding
    that take into account the local context, is more likely to succeed.


    The International Health Regulations (IHR) should be considered as an infrastructure
    for data sharing. However, their lack of enforcement mechanism, lack of minimum
    data sets, lack of capacity assessment mechanism, and potential impact on trade
    and travel following data sharing need to be addressed.

- abstract: 'Background: Investigation into personal health has become focused on
    conditions at an increasingly local level, while response rates have declined
    and complicated the process of collecting data at an individual level. Simultaneously,
    social media data have exploded in availability and have been shown to correlate
    with the prevalence of certain health conditions.


    Objective: Facebook likes may be a source of digital data that can complement
    traditional public health surveillance systems and provide data at a local level.
    We explored the use of Facebook likes as potential predictors of health outcomes
    and their behavioral determinants.


    Methods: We performed principal components and regression analyses to examine
    the predictive qualities of Facebook likes with regard to mortality, diseases,
    and lifestyle behaviors in 214 counties across the United States and 61 of 67
    counties in Florida. These results were compared with those obtainable from a
    demographic model. Health data were obtained from both the 2010 and 2011 Behavioral
    Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and mortality data were obtained from
    the National Vital Statistics System.

    Results: Facebook likes added significant value in predicting most examined health
    outcomes and behaviors even when controlling for age, race, and socioeconomic
    status, with model fit improvements (adjusted R2) of an average of 58% across
    models for 13 different health-related metrics over basic sociodemographic models.
    Small area data were not available in sufficient abundance to test the accuracy
    of the model in estimating health conditions in less populated markets, but initial
    analysis using data from Florida showed a strong model fit for obesity data (adjusted
    R2=.77).


    Conclusions: Facebook likes provide estimates for examined health outcomes and
    health behaviors that are comparable to those obtained from the BRFSS. Online
    sources may provide more reliable, timely, and cost-effective county-level data
    than that obtainable from traditional public health surveillance systems as well
    as serve as an adjunct to those systems.'

- abstract: Over 2014, the Cornell University Legal Information Institute and the
    Australian National University worked with users of the Cornell LII site in a
    citizen science project to collect over 43,000 crowdsourced assessments of the
    readability of legal and other sentences. Readers (“citizen scientists”) on legislative
    pages of the LII site were asked to rate passages from the United States Code
    and the Code of Federal Regulations and other texts for readability and other
    characteristics. They were also asked to provide information about themselves
    as part of the audience that uses legislation online. The overall aim of the project
    was to develop empirical insights into characteristics of law that may make it
    easy or hard to read for the audience that use it. Also, the project aimed to
    assess machine learning for automatically predicting readability of legal sentences
    at sentence level. A major focus of this paper is to report results and insights
    from demographic data collected during the study. Understanding the audience which
    reads the law is directly relevant to readability - as the relevant question is
    readable by whom? Who are the citizens for whom “citizen access” might be enhanced?
    The paper also describes methods used to rank sentences by readability, using
    the data provided by citizen scientists. Finally, the paper reports initial tests
    on the viability of machine learning as a means of predicting readability in advance.
    The exploratory machine learning results reported here will be extended in further
    work reported in a future paper. The research provides insight into who uses legal
    rules and how they do so. We draw conclusions as to the current readability of
    law, as well as the spread of readability among legal rules. The research creates
    a dataset of legal rules labelled for readability by human judges. As far as we
    are aware, this research project is the largest ever study of readability of regulatory
    language and the first research which has applied crowdsourcing to such an investigation.

    data are currently being applied, as well as potential new uses for active transportation
    research and planning efforts of various types.


    The objectives of this white paper are to review existing crowdsourced bicycle
    and pedestrian data resources and crowdsourcing tools; discuss potential planning
    implementations of crowdsourced data for a sample of bicycle and pedestrian project
    types; and provide examples of how crowdsourcing is currently being used to inform
    decision-making. Potential issues related to crowdsourced data are also considered
    (e.g., quality, privacy concerns, participation rates, bias). The research presented
    here highlights a decreasing skepticism over the quality of volunteered, user-generated
    data provided by amateurs (as opposed to professionals) in light of a desire to
    open the lines of communication between the planning world and those affected
    by planning decisions, directly addressing (rather than being discouraged by)
    data limitations. The initiatives surrounding progressive data collection, management,
    and analysis are further reflected in the numerous conferences, meetups, and other
    events fostering collaboration between planners, developers, data scientists and
    others interested in applying critical thought and innovation in planning.


    While this paper reviews existing crowdsourcing techniques and their current applications
    in planning, the pace of technological change and rate of adoption in planning
    indicates that planners will continue to develop and apply innovative approaches
    like crowdsourcing in response to continually changing community needs. This paper
    focuses on examples of current uses of crowdsourced data, crowdsourcing data suggestions,
    and data considerations.'

- abstract: 'Since 2009 there has been a growing interest in defining and operationalising
    innovation for use in the humanitarian context. The increase in scale of new crises,
    the urbanisation of many displaced populations, and stretched financing for humanitarian
    assistance are forcing international aid agencies to think and act in new ways.
    Along with other international humanitarian actors, several United Nations (UN)
    bodies are engaging with new tools and practices to bring innovation to the forefront
    of their work. Within these agencies, there has been a growing movement to establish
    ‘innovation spaces’ or ‘innovation labs’. These labs take different forms – some
    virtual, others physical – and each is created with its own motivations unique
    to the context in which it operates. Despite the variation, there is a growing
    trend in the UN system, and more broadly in the international humanitarian community,
    to create labs as a way to engage in and facilitate innovation practice. This
    research seeks to understand the way in which innovation labs across several UN
    agencies are being used to foster new ways of operating within the UN’s bureaucratic
    structures. We ask four key questions: What form do innovation labs in UN agencies
    take? What motivated their initiation? What are their aims and objectives? What
    impact have they had and how is the impact being measured? As innovation practice
    gains momentum, we reflect on the future of innovation spaces as a way to foster
    innovation within the UN system. We conclude with six key recommendations.'

- abstract: Crowdsourcing legislation gives ordinary citizens, rather than political
    and bureaucratic elites, the chance to cooperate to come up with innovative new
    policies. By increasing popular involvement, representative democracies hope to
    restock dwindling reserves of political legitimacy. However, it is still not clear
    how involvement in legislative decision making affects the attitudes of the participants.
    It is therefore of central concern to establish whether crowdsourcing can actually
    help restore political legitimacy by creating more positive attitudes toward the
    political system. This article contributes to this research agenda by examining
    the developments in attitudes among the users on the Finnish website Avoin Ministeriö
    (“Open Ministry”) which orchestrates crowdsourcing of legislation by providing
    online tools for deliberating ideas for citizens' initiatives. The developments
    in attitudes are investigated with a two-stage survey of 421 respondents who answered
    questions concerning political and social attitudes, as well as political activities
    performed. The results suggest that while crowdsourcing legislation has so far
    not affected political legitimacy in a positive manner, it has the potential to
    do so.

- abstract: Over the last century, state and local governments have been challenged
    to keep proactive, emergency planning efforts ahead of the after-the-disaster,
    response efforts. After moving from decentralized to centralized planning efforts,
    the most recent policy has returned to the philosophy that a decentralized planning
    approach is the most effective way to plan for a disaster. In fact, under the
    Obama administration, a policy of using the “whole community” approach to emergency
    planning has been adopted. This approach, however, creates an obvious problem
    for state and local government practitioners already under pressure for funding,
    time, and the continuous need for higher and broader expertise—the problem of
    how to actually incorporate the whole community into emergency planning efforts.
    This article suggests one such approach, crowdsourcing, as an option for local
    governments. The crowdsourcer-problem-crowd-platform-solution (CPCPS) model is
    suggested as an initial framework for practitioners seeking a practical application
    and basic comprehension. The model, discussion, and additional examples in this
    essay provide a skeletal framework for state and local governments wishing to
    reach the whole community while under the constraints of time, budget, and technical
    expertise.

- abstract: Governments collect and produce large amounts of data. Increasingly, governments
    worldwide have started to implement open data initiatives and also launch open
    data portals to enable the release of these data in open and reusable formats.
    Therefore, a large number of open data repositories, catalogues and portals have
    been emerging in the world. The greater availability of interoperable and linkable
    open government data catalyzes secondary use of such data, so they can be used
    for building useful applications which leverage their value, allow insight, provide
    access to government services, and support transparency. The efficient development
    of successful open data portals makes it necessary to evaluate them systematic,
    in order to understand them better and assess the various types of value they
    generate, and identify the required improvements for increasing this value. Thus,
    the attention of this paper is directed particularly to the field of open data
    portals. The main aim of this paper is to compare the selected open data portals
    on the national level using content analysis and propose a new evaluation framework,
    which further improves the quality of these portals. It also establishes a set
    of considerations for involving businesses and citizens to create eservices and
    applications that leverage on the datasets available from these portals.

- abstract: The global landscape in the supply, co-creation and use of geospatial
    data is changing very rapidly with new satellites, sensors and mobile devices
    reconfiguring the traditional lines of demand and supply and the number of actors
    involved. In this paper we chart some of these technology-led developments and
    then focus on the opportunities they have created for the increased participation
    of the public in generating and contributing information for a wide range of uses,
    scientific and non. Not all this information is open or geospatial, but sufficiently
    large portions of it are to make it one of the most significant phenomena of the
    last decade. In fact, we argue that while satellite and sensors have exponentially
    increased the volumes of geospatial information available, the participation of
    the public is transformative because it expands the range of participants and
    stakeholders in society using and producing geospatial information, with opportunities
    for more direct participation in science, politics and social action.

- abstract: Uganda has democratic deficits where demand for democracy exceeds its
    supply. As a consequence it is argued that a segment of Ugandans might participate
    and honour the freedom to speak out, assemble, and associate given new opportunities
    outside the traditional political channels. With expanded mobile coverage and
    access to mobile devices and services in mind, and using the concept of open crowdsourcing,
    the platform UgandaWatch was launched prior to the 2011 general elections with
    the intention to meet the demand, to offer increased equality of political participation,
    and to advance efforts toward increased citizen engagement in Uganda. From a community
    informatics point of view, the study examined how and under what conditions access
    to ICT tools (mobile devices, networks, and a crowdsourcing platform) can be made
    usable and useful for people and communities for increased political participation
    in a given context. By combining the collection and analysis of quantitative (SMS-survey)
    and qualitative data (focus groups) through a mixed-method approach, this study
    answers the questions, What are the key factors that influence users’ willingness
    to use mobile phones and crowdsourcing platforms as a channel for political participation?,
    and What concerns do users have with respect to using mobile phones and crowdsourcing
    platforms in the participation process? The study shows that users participated
    because they hoped it would bring real change to Uganda’s electoral and political
    landscape, that it was a convenient channel to use (quick and easy) and that confidentiality
    was assured. The user concerns relate to costs, trust, and safety. Crowdsourcing
    offers an alternative channel and may substitute or supplement traditional means
    of political participation. It can increase participation in some groups, including
    among those who normally do not participate—something that increases equality
    of political participation in a positive direction.

- abstract: Recent debate and associated initiatives dealing with public sector innovation
    have mainly aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery
    of public services and improved transparency and user friendliness. Beyond typical
    administrative reforms, innovation is expected to help address societal challenges
    such as the aging population, inclusion, health care, education, public safety,
    environment and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The public sector consists
    of a complex open system of organizations with various tasks. Therefore, decision-making
    can be slower than in the private sector because of large chains of command. Innovations
    here will often have an impact across this complex organizational structure, and
    thus must be supported by a robust strategy. To strengthen democracy, promote
    government efficiency and effectiveness, discourage wastes and misuses of government
    resources, public administrations have to promote a new stronger level of openness
    in government. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe an innovative approach
    for the governance of public systems and services, currently applied in the Italian
    public administration domain, which could be easily replicated in other countries
    as well. Two initiatives, to collect and provide relevant public information gathered
    from different and heterogeneous public organizations, to improve government processes
    and increase quality of services for citizens and companies, are described. The
    cases adopted have been validated through a case analysis approach involving the
    Italian Agency for the public administration digitalization to understand new
    e-government scenarios within the context of governmental reforms heavily influenced
    by the principles of Open Government Model.

- abstract: Given that the Obama administration still relies on many strategies we
    would think of as sitting on the side of secrecy, it seems that the only lasting
    transparency legacy of the Obama administration will be data-driven or e-transparency
    as exemplified by the web interface ‘data.gov’. As the data-driven transparency
    model is exported and assumes an ascendant position around the globe, it is imperative
    that we ask what kind of publics, subjects, and indeed, politics it will produce.
    Open government data is not just a matter concerning accountability but is seen
    as a necessary component of the new ‘data economy’. To participate and benefit
    from this info-capitalist-democracy, the data subject is called upon to be both
    auditor and entrepreneur. This article explores the implications of responsibilization,
    outsourcing, and commodification on the contract of representational democracy
    and asks if there are other forms of transparency that might better resist neoliberal
    formations and re-politicize the public sphere.

- abstract: 'Purpose

    – The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for better analyzing the utility
    and impact of new technologies on smart cities. The authors have designed a tool
    that will evaluate new technologies according to a three-pronged scoring system
    that considers the impact on physical space, environmental issues and city residents.
    The purpose of this tool is to be used by city planners as part of a strategic
    approach to the implementation of a smart city initiative in order to reduce unnecessary
    public spending and ensure the optimal allocation of city resources.


    Design/methodology/approach

    – The information and communication technologies that manage and transform twenty-first
    century cities must be reviewed, analyzing their impact on new social behaviors
    that shape the spaces and means of communication, developing a new methodology
    and setting the basis for an analysis matrix to score the different and technologies
    that affect a smart city environment.


    Research limitations/implications

    – Traditional technological scenarios have been challenged, and smart cities have
    become the center of urban competitiveness. A lack of clarity has been detected
    in the way of describing what smart cities are, and the authors try to establish
    a methodology for urban policy makers to do so. As a dynamic process that affects
    several aspects, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed solution further.


    Practical implications

    – After a review of the state-of-the-art, the authors found that there are no
    existing systems for assessing smart city strategies regarding new, evolving technologies.
    The methodology attempts to design a simple tool to bring urban developers and
    policy makers closer to the technology and to have an instrument with which to
    compare different alternatives before choosing one.


    Social implications

    – Helped by new technologies, citizens are the ones who have the power to define
    new urban scenarios. For this reason the methodology the authors propose must
    have citizens and their needs as the ultimate reference, considering all the social,
    physical and environmental effects on people before selecting a new technology
    for urban strategies.


    Originality/value

    – This paper fulfills an identified need to study how new technologies could affect
    urban scenarios before being applied, developing an analysis system in the form
    of a matrix to be used by urban planners and policy makers to decide how best
    to use them.'

- abstract: "A statement or action can be said to be manipulative if it does not sufficiently\
    \ engage or appeal to people’s capacity for reflective and deliberative choice.\
    \ One problem with manipulation, thus understood, is that it fails to respect\
    \ people’s autonomy and is an affront to their dignity. Another problem is that\
    \ if they are products of manipulation, people’s choices might fail to promote\
    \ their own welfare, and might instead promote the welfare of the manipulator.\
    \ To that extent, the central objection to manipulation is rooted in a version\
    \ of Mill’s Harm Principle: People know what is in their best interests and should\
    \ have a (manipulation-free) opportunity to make that decision. On welfarist grounds,\
    \ the norm against manipulation can be seen as a kind of heuristic, one that generally\
    \ works well, but that can also lead to serious errors, at least when the manipulator\
    \ is both informed and genuinely interested in the welfare of the chooser. \n\n\
    For the legal system, a pervasive puzzle is why manipulation is rarely policed.\
    \ The simplest answer is that manipulation has so many shades, and in a social\
    \ order that values free markets and is committed to freedom of expression, it\
    \ is exceptionally difficult to regulate manipulation as such. But as the manipulator’s\
    \ motives become more self-interested or venal, and as efforts to bypass people’s\
    \ deliberative capacities becomes more successful, the ethical objections to manipulation\
    \ become very forceful, and the argument for a legal response is fortified. The\
    \ analysis of manipulation bears on emerging first amendment issues raised by\
    \ compelled speech, especially in the context of graphic health warnings. Importantly,\
    \ it can also help orient the regulation of financial products, where manipulation\
    \ of consumer choices is an evident but rarely explicit concern."

- abstract: 'Innovation is a key driver in organizational sustainability, and yes,
    openness and transparency are a recipe for innovation. But, according to Tapscott
    and Williams, “when it comes to innovation, competitive advantage and organizational
    success, ‘openness’ is rarely the first word one would use to describe companies
    and other societal organizations like government agencies or medical institutions.
    For many, words like ‘insular,’ ‘bureaucratic,’ ‘hierarchical,’ ‘secretive’ and
    ‘closed’ come to mind instead.”1 And yet a few months ago, The Tesla Model S just
    became the world''s first open-source car. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motor Vehicles,
    shared all the patents on Tesla''s electric car technology, allowing anyone —
    including competitors — to use them without fear of litigation. Elon wrote in
    his post “Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo
    Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the
    spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology.”2

    In the public sector, terms such as open government, citizen sourcing, and wiki
    government are also akin to the notion of open innovation and transparency. As
    Hilgers and Ihl report, “a good example of this approach is the success of the
    Future Melbourne program, a Wiki and blog-based approach to shaping the future
    urban landscape of Australia’s second largest city. The program allowed citizens
    to directly edit and comment on the plans for the future development of the city.
    It attracted more than 30,000 individuals, who submitted hundreds of comments
    and suggestions (futuremelbourne.com.au). Basically, problems concerning design
    and creativity, future strategy and local culture, and even questions of management
    and service innovation can be broadcasted on such web-platforms.”3 The authors
    suggest that there are three dimensions to applying the concept of open innovation
    to the public sector: citizen ideation and innovation (tapping knowledge and creativity),
    collaborative administration (user generated new tasks and processes), and collaborative
    democracy (improve public participation in the policy process).'

- abstract: The paper explores the motivations of volunteers in a large crowd sourcing
    project and contributes to our understanding of the motivational factors that
    lead to deeper engagement beyond initial participation. Drawing on the theory
    of legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) and the literature on motivation
    in crowd sourcing, we analyze interview and trace data from a large citizen science
    project. The analyses identify ways in which the technical features of the projects
    may serve as motivational factors leading participants towards sustained participation.
    The results suggest volunteers first engage in activities to support knowledge
    acquisition and later share knowledge with other volunteers and finally increase
    participation in Talk through a punctuated process of role discovery.

- abstract: Computing power and analytical methods allow us to create, collate, and
    analyze more data than ever before. When datasets are unusually large in volume,
    velocity, and variety, they are referred to as “big data.” Some observers have
    suggested that in order to cope with big data (a) organizational structures will
    need to change and (b) the processes used to design organizations will be different.
    In this article, we differentiate big data from relatively slow-moving, linked
    people data. We argue that big data will change organizational structures as organizations
    pursue the opportunities presented by big data. The processes by which organizations
    are designed, however, will be relatively unaffected by big data. Instead, organization
    design processes will be more affected by the complex links found in people data.

- abstract: Citizens and governments live increasingly digital lives, leaving trails
    of digital data that have the potential to support unprecedented levels of mutual
    government–citizen understanding, and in turn, vast improvements to public policies
    and services. Open data and open government initiatives promise to “open up” government
    operations to citizens. New forms of “big data” analysis can be used by government
    itself to understand citizens' behavior and reveal the strengths and weaknesses
    of policy and service delivery. In practice, however, open data emerges as a reform
    development directed to a range of goals, including the stimulation of economic
    development, and not strictly transparency or public service improvement. Meanwhile,
    governments have been slow to capitalize on the potential of big data, while the
    largest data they do collect remain “closed” and under-exploited within the confines
    of intelligence agencies. Drawing on interviews with civil servants and researchers
    in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States between 2011 and 2014, this
    article argues that a big data approach could offer the greatest potential as
    a vehicle for improving mutual government–citizen understanding, thus embodying
    the core tenets of Digital Era Governance, argued by some authors to be the most
    viable public management model for the digital age (Dunleavy, Margetts, Bastow,
    & Tinkler, 2005, 2006; Margetts & Dunleavy, 2013).

- abstract: 'The concept of open government, having been promoted widely in the past
    5 years, has promised a broader notion than e-government, as supposed to fundamentally
    transform governments to become more open and participative and collaborative.
    Unfortunately, this has not significantly enhanced a set of fundamental problems
    regarding e-government. One of the problems is that the underlying democratic
    ideology is rarely clearly expressed. In this paper, we have therefore constructed
    a framework for the analysis of open government from a democratic perspective,
    to explore the research foundation of open government and the types of research
    missing. We have looked closely at the notion of democracy in peer-reviewed journals
    on open government from 2009 to 2013, focusing on discussions of some fundamental
    issues regarding democracy and the type of solutions suggested. We have found
    that despite seemingly good intentions and an extensive rhetoric, there is still
    an apparent lack of adequate tools in which public deliberation and representation
    are addressed in any meaningful sense. There are two main important observations
    herein: (i) the rhetoric in the dominant discourse supports the concept of open
    government formulated by the Obama administration as transparency, participation,
    and collaboration, but in practice, the focus is predominantly on transparency
    and information exchange, while ignoring fundamental democratic issues regarding
    participation and collaboration, and (ii) the concept of the public is inadequately
    considered as a homogenous entity rather than a diversified group with different

- abstract: 'Open government initiatives in the U.S. government focus on three main
    aspects: transparency, participation, and collaboration. Especially the collaboration
    mandate is relatively unexplored in the literature. In practice, government organizations
    recognize the need to include external problem solvers into their internal innovation
    creation processes. This is partly derived from a sense of urgency to improve
    the efficiency and quality of government service delivery. Another formal driver
    is the America Competes Act that instructs agencies to search for opportunities
    to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science. Government
    agencies are responding to these requirements by using open innovation (OI) approaches
    to invite citizens to crowdsource and peer produce solutions to public management
    problems. These distributed innovation processes occur at all levels of the U.S.
    government and it is important to understand what design elements are used to
    create innovative public management ideas. This article systematically reviews
    existing government crowdsourcing and peer production initiatives and shows that
    after agencies have defined their public management problem, they go through four
    different phases of the OI process: (1) idea generation through crowdsourcing,
    (2) incubation of submitted ideas with peer voting and collaborative improvements
    of favorite solutions, (3) validation with a proof of concept of implementation
    possibilities, and (4) reveal of the selected solution and the (internal) implementation
    of the winning idea. Participation and engagement are incentivized both with monetary
    and nonmonetary rewards, which lead to tangible solutions as well as intangible
    innovation outcomes, such as increased public awareness.'

- abstract: Reflecting on the governance of smart cities, the state-of-the-art this
    paper advances offers a critique of recent city ranking and future Internet accounts
    of their development. Armed with these critical insights, it goes on to explain
    smart cities in terms of the social networks, cultural attributes and environmental
    capacities, vis-a-vis, vital ecologies of the intellectual capital, wealth creation
    and standards of participatory governance regulating their development. The Triple
    Helix model which the paper advances to explain these performances in turn suggests
    that cities are smart when the ICTs of future Internet developments successfully
    embed the networks society needs for them to not only generate intellectual capital,
    or create wealth, but also cultivate the environmental capacity, ecology and vitality
    of those spaces which the direct democracy of their participatory governance open
    up, add value to and construct.

- abstract: Social media has provided governments with new means to improve efficiency
    and innovation, by engaging a crowd in the gathering and development of data.
    These collaborative processes are also described as a way to improve democracy
    by enabling a more transparent and deliberative democracy where citizens participate
    more directly in decision processes on different levels. However, the dominant
    research on the e-democratic field takes a government perspective rather then
    a citizen perspective. Edemocracy from the perspective of the individual actor,
    in a global context, is less developed. In this paper I therefore develop a model
    for a democratic process outside the realm of the nation state, in a performative
    state where inequality is norm and the state is unclear and fluid. In this process
    eparticipation means an ICT supported method to get a diversity of opinions and
    perspectives rather than one single. This micro perspective on democratic participation
    online might be useful for development of tools for more democratic online crowds.

- abstract: 'Background: Existing influenza surveillance in the United States is focused
    on the collection of data from sentinel physicians and hospitals; however, the
    compilation and distribution of reports are usually delayed by up to 2 weeks.
    With the popularity of social media growing, the Internet is a source for syndromic
    surveillance due to the availability of large amounts of data. In this study,
    tweets, or posts of 140 characters or less, from the website Twitter were collected
    and analyzed for their potential as surveillance for seasonal influenza.

    Objective: There were three aims: (1) to improve the correlation of tweets to
    sentinel-provided influenza-like illness (ILI) rates by city through filtering
    and a machine-learning classifier, (2) to observe correlations of tweets for emergency
    department ILI rates by city, and (3) to explore correlations for tweets to laboratory-confirmed
    influenza cases in San Diego.

    Methods: Tweets containing the keyword “flu” were collected within a 17-mile radius
    from 11 US cities selected for population and availability of ILI data. At the
    end of the collection period, 159,802 tweets were used for correlation analyses
    with sentinel-provided ILI and emergency department ILI rates as reported by the
    corresponding city or county health department. Two separate methods were used
    to observe correlations between tweets and ILI rates: filtering the tweets by
    type (non-retweets, retweets, tweets with a URL, tweets without a URL), and the
    use of a machine-learning classifier that determined whether a tweet was “valid”,
    or from a user who was likely ill with the flu.

    Results: Correlations varied by city but general trends were observed. Non-retweets
    and tweets without a URL had higher and more significant (P<.05) correlations
    than retweets and tweets with a URL. Correlations of tweets to emergency department
    ILI rates were higher than the correlations observed for sentinel-provided ILI
    for most of the cities. The machine-learning classifier yielded the highest correlations
    for many of the cities when using the sentinel-provided or emergency department
    ILI as well as the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego.
    High correlation values (r=.93) with significance at P<.001 were observed for
    laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for most categories and tweets determined
    to be valid by the classifier.

    Conclusions: Compared to tweet analyses in the previous influenza season, this
    study demonstrated increased accuracy in using Twitter as a supplementary surveillance
    tool for influenza as better filtering and classification methods yielded higher
    correlations for the 2013-2014 influenza season than those found for tweets in
    the previous influenza season, where emergency department ILI rates were better
    correlated to tweets than sentinel-provided ILI rates. Further investigations
    in the field would require expansion with regard to the location that the tweets
    are collected from, as well as the availability of more ILI data.'

- abstract: The agglomeration of rules and regulations over time has produced a body
    of legal code that no single individual can fully comprehend. This complexity
    produces inefficiencies, makes the processes of understanding and changing the
    law difficult, and frustrates the fundamental principle that the law should provide
    fair notice to the governed. In this article, we take a quantitative, unbiased,
    and software-engineering approach to analyze the evolution of the United States
    Code from 1926 to today. Software engineers frequently face the challenge of understanding
    and managing large, structured collections of instructions, directives, and conditional
    statements, and we adapt and apply their techniques to the U.S. Code over time.
    Our work produces insights into the structure of the U.S. Code as a whole, its
    strengths and vulnerabilities, and new ways of thinking about individual laws.
    For example, we identify the first appearance and spread of important terms in
    the U.S. Code like "whistleblower" and "privacy." We also analyze and visualize
    the network structure of certain substantial reforms, including the Patient Protection
    and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
    Protection Act, and show how the interconnections of references can increase complexity
    and create the potential for unintended consequences. Our work is a timely illustration
    of computational approaches to law as the legal profession embraces technology
    for scholarship, to increase efficiency, and to improve access to justice.

- abstract: "This article seeks to map out the prospects of crowd-sourcing technologies\
    \ in the area of corruption-reporting. A flurry of initiative and concomitant\
    \ media hype in this area has led to exuberant hopes that the end of impunity\
    \ is not such a distant possibility any more - at least not for the most blatant,\
    \ ubiquitous and visible forms of administrative corruption, such as bribes and\
    \ extortion payments that on average almost a quarter of citizens reported to\
    \ face year in, year out in their daily lives in so many countries around the\
    \ world (Transparency International 2013). \n\nOnly with hindsight will we be\
    \ able to tell, if these hopes were justified. However, a closer look at an interdisciplinary\
    \ body of literature on corruption and social mobilisation can help shed some\
    \ interesting light on these questions and offer a fresh perspective on the potential\
    \ of social media based crowd-sourcing for better governance and less corruption.\
    \ So far the potential of crowd-sourcing is mainly approached from a technology-centred\
    \ perspective. Where challenges are identified, pondered, and worked upon they\
    \ are primarily technical and managerial in nature, ranging from issues of privacy\
    \ protection and fighting off hacker attacks to challenges of data management,\
    \ information validation or fundraising. \n\nIn contrast, short shrift is being\
    \ paid to insights from a substantive, multi-disciplinary and growing body of\
    \ literature on how corruption works, how it can be fought and more generally\
    \ how observed logics of collective action and social mobilisation interact with\
    \ technological affordances and condition the success of these efforts. \n\nThis\
    \ imbalanced debate is not really surprising as it seems to follow the trajectory\
    \ of the hype-and-bust cycle that we have seen in the public debate for a variety\
    \ of other technology applications. From electronic health cards to smart government,\
    \ to intelligent transport systems, all these and many other highly ambitious\
    \ initiatives start with technology-centric visions of transformational impact.\
    \ However, over time - with some hard lessons learnt and large sums spent - they\
    \ all arrive at a more pragmatic and nuanced view on how social and economic forces\
    \ shape the implementation of such technologies and require a more shrewd design\
    \ approach, in order to make it more likely that potential actually translates\
    \ into impact.\n\nAt a minimum, a trawl through this literature makes it possible\
    \ to move beyond some of the most common-sense conjectures and develop a few more\
    \ granular guesses on the future of crowd-sourcing corruption. At best, this approach\
    \ may help identify some not so obvious challenges that may arise along the way\
    \ and ensure that they are considered in the design process of future corruption\
    \ crowd-sourcing interventions, raising their likelihood of impact and sustainable\
    \ success.\n\nThe remainder of this essay is structured as follows: Section 1\
    \ introduces the concept of crowd-sourcing for good governance. It provides a\
    \ very brief overview of some related initiatives in this area, alongside some\
    \ of the challenges and reservations that are commonly raised in the debate. Section\
    \ 2 casts the net a bit wider. It looks for interesting insight and cues in the\
    \ broader social science literature on social mobilisation and corruption. Based\
    \ on this, it seeks to gain a better understanding of what other more fundamental\
    \ challenges may lay ahead for crowd-reporting corruption. Section 3 picks up\
    \ on these anticipated challenges and presents some ideas on how to address them,\
    \ both in the design, as well as in the implementation of future crowd-reporting\
    \ systems, drawing both on emerging insights from impact assessments of conventional\
    \ social accountability mechanisms as well as lessons learnt within Transparency\
    \ International’s own global network of anti-corruption NGOs, some of which already\
    \ run crowd-reporting platforms."

- abstract: Most of society's innovation systems – academic science, the patent system,
    open source, etc. – are “open” in the sense that they are designed to facilitate
    knowledge disclosure among innovators. An essential difference across innovation
    systems is whether disclosure is of intermediate progress and solutions or of
    completed innovations. We theorize and present experimental evidence linking intermediate
    versus final disclosure to an ‘incentives-versus-reuse’ tradeoff and to a transformation
    of the innovation search process. We find intermediate disclosure has the advantage
    of efficiently steering development towards improving existing solution approaches,
    but also has the effect of limiting experimentation and narrowing technological
    search. We discuss the comparative advantages of intermediate versus final disclosure
    policies in fostering innovation.

- abstract: 'Although a great many different crowdsourcing approaches are available
    to those seeking to accomplish individual or organizational tasks, little research
    attention has yet been given to characterizing how those approaches might be based
    on task characteristics. To that end, we conducted an extensive review of the
    crowdsourcing landscape, including a look at what types of taxonomies are currently
    available. Our review found that no taxonomy explored the multidimensional nature
    of task complexity. This paper develops a taxonomy whose specific intent is the
    classification of approaches in terms of the types of tasks for which they are
    best suited. To develop this task-based taxonomy, we followed an iterative approach
    that considered over 100 well-known examples of crowdsourcing. The taxonomy considers
    three dimensions of task complexity: (a) task structure – is the task well-defined,
    or does it require a more open-ended solution; (2) task interdependence – can
    the task be solved by an individual, or does it require a community of problem
    solvers; and (3) task commitment – what level of commitment is expected from crowd
    members? Based on this taxonomy, we identify seven categories of crowdsourcing
    and discuss prototypical examples of each approach. Furnished with such an understanding,
    one should be able to determine which crowdsourcing approach is most suitable
    for a particular task situation.'

- abstract: 'Explaining individual behavior in politics should rely on the same motivational
    assumptions as explaining behavior in the market: That’s what Political Economy,
    understood as the application of economics to the study of political processes,
    is all about. In its standard variant, those who played the game of politics should
    also be considered rational and self-interested, unlike the benevolent despot
    of earlier models. History repeats itself with the rise of behavioral economics:
    Assuming cognitive biases to be present in the market, but not in politics, behavioral
    economists often call for government to intervene in a “benevolent” way. Recently,
    however, political economists have started to apply behavioral economics insights
    to the study of political processes, thereby re-establishing a unified methodology.
    This paper surveys the current state of the emerging field of “Behavioral Political
    Economy” and considers the scope for further research.'

- abstract: 'Nowadays there is a multitude of mobile and tablet applications being
    developed in order to facilitate or disrupt every day tasks. Many of these are
    location based. A technique to serve in providing information and content is crowdsourcing.
    This technique is based on the public contributing information or resources giving
    them the opportunity to become both service providers and recipients at the same
    time.


    Taking into account the above and after observing passengers using the public
    transport system, we came to the conclusion that it would be useful to be able
    to determine which transport medium (i.e which bus line out of a number running
    concurrently) is nearer at any given moment. This information allows for better
    decision making and choice of transportation.


    For this we propose the development of an application to show the position of
    a selected transport vehicle. The position will be calculated based on geo-tracking
    provided by passengers boarded on a vehicle. This will allow for real time information
    to the application users in order to be able to determine their optimal route.'

- abstract: 'Over the last decade, there have been significant changes in data sharing
    policies and in the data sharing environment faced by life science researchers.
    Using data from a 2013 survey of over 1600 life science researchers, we analyze
    the effects of sharing policies of funding agencies and journals. We also examine
    the effects of new sharing infrastructure and tools (i.e., third party repositories
    and online supplements). We find that recently enacted data sharing policies and
    new sharing infrastructure and tools have had a sizable effect on encouraging
    data sharing. In particular, third party repositories and online supplements as
    well as data sharing requirements of funding agencies, particularly the NIH and
    the National Human Genome Research Institute, were perceived by scientists to
    have had a large effect on facilitating data sharing. In addition, we found a
    high degree of compliance with these new policies, although noncompliance resulted
    in few formal or informal sanctions. Despite the overall effectiveness of data
    sharing policies, some significant gaps remain: about one third of grant reviewers
    placed no weight on data sharing plans in their reviews, and a similar percentage
    ignored the requirements of material transfer agreements. These patterns suggest
    that although most of these new policies have been effective, there is still room
    for policy improvement.'

- abstract: This study adds to the body of research on open government by empirically
    measuring the association of government transparency and innovation. The study
    uses Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) as a proxy
    measure of government transparency. It assumes that an increase in government
    transparency increases applied innovation activity, which is measured as the number
    of annual patents by country residents. The study also tests whether the association
    is different for countries participating in the Open Government Partnership (OGP),
    a voluntary multi-stakeholder international collaboration of 63 countries who
    have committed to make their governments more transparent. The analysis uses fixed
    effects regression on panel data from 1996 to 2011 for 95 countries, including
    54 OGP members. Although the empirical results do not support the hypothesis that
    transparency and innovation are positively correlated for countries participating
    in the OGP, this finding contributes to the literature on open government by making
    an initial attempt to quantify the association of transparency and innovation.
    Additional future research demonstrating a positive relationship between transparency
    and innovation could help to justify implementation of open government policies
    and participation in the Open Government Partnership.

- abstract: This paper examines some of the science communication challenges involved
    when designing and conducting public deliberation processes on issues of national
    importance. We take as our illustrative case study a recent research project investigating
    public values and attitudes toward future energy system change for the United
    Kingdom. National-level issues such as this are often particularly difficult to
    engage the public with because of their inherent complexity, derived from multiple
    interconnected elements and policy frames, extended scales of analysis, and different
    manifestations of uncertainty. With reference to the energy system project, we
    discuss ways of meeting a series of science communication challenges arising when
    engaging the public with national topics, including the need to articulate systems
    thinking and problem scale, to provide balanced information and policy framings
    in ways that open up spaces for reflection and deliberation, and the need for
    varied methods of facilitation and data synthesis that permit access to participants’
    broader values. Although resource intensive, national-level deliberation is possible
    and can produce useful insights both for participants and for science policy.

- abstract: The widespread availability of high-quality Web-based content offers new
    potential for supporting teachers as designers of curricula and classroom activities.
    When coupled with a participatory Web culture and infrastructure, teachers can
    share their creations as well as leverage from the best that their peers have
    to offer to support a collective intelligence or crowdsourcing community, which
    we dubcrowdteaching. We applied a collective intelligence framework to characterize
    crowdteaching in the context of a Web-based tool for teachers called the Instructional
    Architect (IA). The IA enables teachers to find, create, and share instructional
    activities (called IA projects) for their students using online learning resources.
    These IA projects can further be viewed, copied, or adapted by other IA users.
    This study examines the usage activities of two samples of teachers, and also
    analyzes the characteristics of a subset of their IA projects. Analyses of teacher
    activities suggest that they are engaging in crowdteaching processes. Teachers,
    on average, chose to share over half of their IA projects, and copied some directly
    from other IA projects. Thus, these teachers can be seen as both contributors
    to and consumers of crowdteaching processes. In addition, IA users preferred to
    view IA projects rather than to completely copy them. Finally, correlational results
    based on an analysis of the characteristics of IA projects suggest that several
    easily computed metrics (number of views, number of copies, and number of words
    in IA projects) can act as an indirect proxy of instructionally relevant indicators
    of the content of IA projects.

- abstract: Research on open innovation suggests that companies benefit differentially
    from adopting open innovation strategies; however, it is unclear why this is so.
    One possible explanation is that companies’ business models are not attuned to
    open strategies. Accordingly, we propose a contingency model of open business
    models by systematically linking open innovation strategies to core business model
    dimensions, notably the content, structure, governance of transactions. We further
    illustrate a continuum of open innovativeness, differentiating between four types
    of open business models. We contribute to the open innovation literature by specifying
    the conditions under which business models are conducive to the success of open
    innovation strategies.

- abstract: Despite the availability of a myriad of Information and Communication
    Technologies (ICT) based tools and methodologies for supporting governance and
    the formulation of policies, including modelling expected impacts, these have
    proved to be unable to cope with the dire challenges of the contemporary society.
    In this chapter we present the results of the analysis of a set of promising cases
    researched in order to understand the possible impact of what we define ‘Policy
    Making 2.0’, which refers to ‘a set of methodologies and technological solutions
    aimed at enabling better, timely and participative policy-making’. Based on the
    analysis of these cases we suggest a bouquet of (mostly ICT-related) practical
    and research recommendations that are relevant to researchers, practitioners and
    policy makers in order to guide the introduction and implementation of Policy
    Making 2.0 initiatives. We argue that this ‘decalogue’ of Policy Making 2.0 could
    be an operational checklist for future research and policy to further explore
    the potential of ICT tools for governance and policy modelling, so to make next
    generation policy making more ‘intelligent’ and hopefully able to solve or anticipate
    the societal challenges we are (and will be) confronted today and in the future.

- abstract: 'Developing and commercializing novel ideas is central to innovation processes.
    As the outcome of such ideas cannot fully be foreseen, the evaluation of them
    is crucial. With the rise of the internet and ICT, more and new kinds of evaluations
    are done by crowds. This raises the question whether individuals in crowds possess
    necessary capabilities to evaluate and whether their outcomes are valid. As empirical
    insights are not yet available, this paper deals with the examination of evaluation
    processes and general evaluation components, the discussion of underlying characteristics
    and mechanism of these components affecting evaluation outcomes (i.e. evaluation
    validity). We further investigate differences between firm- and crowd-based evaluation
    using different cases of applications, and develop a theoretical framework towards
    evaluation validity, i.e. validity by numbers vs. the validity by expertise. The
    identified factors that influence the validity of evaluations are: (1) the number
    of evaluation tasks, (2) complexity, (3) expertise, (4) costs, and (5) time to
    outcome. For each of these factors, hypotheses are developed based on theoretical
    arguments. We conclude with implications, proposing a model of evaluation validity.'

- abstract: Open data initiatives are characterized, in several countries, by a great
    extension of the number of data sets made available for access by public administrations,
    constituencies, businesses and other actors, such as journalists, international
    institutions and academics, to mention a few. However, most of the open data sets
    rely on selection criteria, based on a technology-driven perspective, rather than
    a focus on the potential public and social value of data to be published. Several
    experiences and reports confirm this issue, such as those of the Open Data Census.
    However, there are also relevant best practices. The goal of this paper is to
    investigate the different dimensions of a framework suitable to support public
    administrations, as well as constituencies, in assessing and benchmarking the
    social value of open data initiatives. The framework is tested on three initiatives,
    referring to three different countries, Italy, the United Kingdom and Tunisia.
    The countries have been selected to provide a focus on European and Mediterranean
    countries, considering also the difference in legal frameworks (civic law vs.
    common law countries).

- abstract: There are over 3 billion searches globally on Google every day. This report
    examines whether Google search queries can be used to predict the present and
    the near future unemployment rate in Finland. Predicting the present and the near
    future is of interest, as the official records of the state of the economy are
    published with a delay. To assess the information contained in Google search queries,
    the report compares a simple predictive model of unemployment to a model that
    contains a variable, Google Index, formed from Google data. In addition, cross-correlation
    analysis and Granger-causality tests are performed. Compared to a simple benchmark,
    Google search queries improve the prediction of the present by 10 % measured by
    mean absolute error. Moreover, predictions using search terms perform 39 % better
    over the benchmark for near future unemployment 3 months ahead. Google search
    queries also tend to improve the prediction accuracy around turning points. The
    results suggest that Google searches contain useful information of the present
    and the near future unemployment rate in Finland.

- abstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review of the current state–of–research
    on online participation. The review draws on four databases and is guided by the
    application of six topical search terms. The analysis strives to differentiate
    distinct forms of online participation and to identify salient discourses within
    each research field. We find that research on online participation is highly segregated
    into specific sub–discourses that reflect disciplinary boundaries. Research on
    online political participation and civic engagement is identified as the most
    prominent and extensive research field. Yet research on other forms of participation,
    such as cultural, business, education and health participation, provides distinct
    perspectives and valuable insights. We outline both field–specific and common
    findings and derive propositions for future research.

- abstract: This article makes three related arguments. First, that although many
    definitions of the smart city have been proposed, corporate promoters say a smart
    city uses information technology to pursue efficient systems through real-time
    monitoring and control. Second, this definition is not new and equivalent to the
    idea of urban cybernetics debated in the 1970s. Third, drawing on a discussion
    of Rio de Janeiro’s Operations Center, I argue that viewing urban problems as
    wicked problems allows for more fundamental solutions than urban cybernetics,
    but requires local innovation and stakeholder participation. Therefore the last
    section describes institutions for municipal innovation and IT-enabled collaborative
    planning.

- abstract: "Improving public health is a major responsibility of any government,\
    \ and is of major interest to citizens and scientific communities around the world.\
    \ Here, one sees two extremes. On one hand, tremendous progress has been made\
    \ in recent years in the understanding of causes, spread and remedies of common\
    \ and regularly occurring diseases like Dengue, Malaria and Japanese Encephalistis\
    \ (JE). On the other hand, public agencies treat these diseases in an ad hoc manner\
    \ without learning from the experiences of previous years. Specifically, they\
    \ would get alerted once reported cases have already arisen substantially in the\
    \ known disease season, reactively initiate a few actions and then document the\
    \ disease impact (cases, deaths) for that period, only to forget this learning\
    \ in the next season. However, they miss the opportunity to reduce preventable\
    \ deaths and sickness, and their corresponding economic impact, which scientific\
    \ progress could have enabled. The gap is universal but very prominent in developing\
    \ countries like India.\n\n \n\nIn this paper, we show that if public agencies\
    \ provide historical disease impact information openly, it can be analyzed with\
    \ statistical and machine learning techniques, correlated with best emerging practices\
    \ in disease control, and simulated in a setting to optimize social benefits to\
    \ provide timely guidance for new disease seasons and regions. We illustrate using\
    \ open data for mosquito-borne communicable diseases; published results in public\
    \ health on efficacy of Dengue control methods and apply it on a simulated typical\
    \ city for maximal benefits with available resources. The exercise helps us further\
    \ suggest strategies for new regions that may be anywhere in the world, how data\
    \ could be better recorded by city agencies and what prevention methods should\
    \ medical community focus on for wider impact."

- abstract: Crowdsourcing allows large-scale and flexible invocation of human input
    for data gathering and analysis, which introduces a new paradigm of data mining
    process. Traditional data mining methods often require the experts in analytic
    domains to annotate the data. However, it is expensive and usually takes a long
    time. Crowdsourcing enables the use of heterogeneous background knowledge from
    volunteers and distributes the annotation process to small portions of efforts
    from different contributions. This paper reviews the state-of-the-arts on the
    crowdsourcing for data mining in recent years. We first review the challenges
    and opportunities of data mining tasks using crowdsourcing, and summarize the
    framework of them. Then we highlight several exemplar works in each component
    of the framework, including question designing, data mining and quality control.
    Finally, we conclude the limitation of crowdsourcing for data mining and suggest
    related areas for future research.

- abstract: 'Background: To date, health research literature has focused on social
    network sites (SNS) either as tools to deliver health care, to study the effect
    of these networks on behavior, or to analyze Web health content. Less is known
    about the effectiveness of these sites as a method for collecting data for health
    research and the means to use such powerful tools in health research.

    Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the available
    literature and explore the use of SNS as a mode of collecting data for health
    research. The review aims to answer four questions: Does health research employ
    SNS as method for collecting data? Is data quality affected by the mode of data
    collection? What types of participants were reached by SNS? What are the strengths
    and limitations of SNS?

    Methods: The literature was reviewed systematically in March 2013 by searching
    the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, using the Ovid and PubMed interface
    from 1996 to the third week of March 2013. The search results were examined by
    2 reviewers, and exclusion, inclusion, and quality assessment were carried out
    based on a pre-set protocol.

    Results: The inclusion criteria were met by 10 studies and results were analyzed
    descriptively to answer the review questions. There were four main results. (1)
    SNS have been used as a data collection tool by health researchers; all but 1
    of the included studies were cross-sectional and quantitative. (2) Data quality
    indicators that were reported include response rate, cost, timeliness, missing
    data/completion rate, and validity. However, comparison was carried out only for
    response rate and cost as it was unclear how other reported indicators were measured.
    (3) The most targeted population were females and younger people. (4) All studies
    stated that SNS is an effective recruitment method but that it may introduce a
    sampling bias.

    Conclusions: SNS has a role in health research, but we need to ascertain how to
    use it effectively without affecting the quality of research. The field of SNS
    is growing rapidly, and it is necessary to take advantage of the strengths of
    this tool and to avoid its limitations by effective research design. This review
    provides an important insight for scholars who plan to conduct research using
    SNS.'

    that can benefit from strategic niche management to foster two key processes:
    technological learning and societal embedding. Moreover, it studies the extent
    to which those processes started to unfold in two paradigmatic cases of smart
    city pilots ‘from scratch’: Songdo (South Korea) and PlanIT Valley (Portugal).
    The rationale and potentials of the two pilots as arenas for socio-technical experimentation

    involved in nurturing socially rich innovation ecosystems and in maintaining social
    and political support over time.'

- abstract: 'This short article argues that an adequate response to the implications
    for governance raised by ‘Big Data’ requires much more attention to agency and
    reflexivity than theories of ‘algorithmic power’ have so far allowed. It develops
    this through two contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors
    used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for example, by community organisations)
    and the study of actors’ attempts to build an economy of information more open
    to civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental
    sphere). The article concludes with a consideration of the broader norms that
    might contextualise these empirical studies, and proposes that they can be understood
    in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice
    as a norm means that voice must sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency.'

- abstract: The public-oriented goals of the open government movement promise increased
    transparency and accountability of governments, enhanced citizen engagement and
    participation, improved service delivery, economic development and the stimulation
    of innovation. In part, these goals are to be achieved by making more and more
    government information public in reusable formats and under open licences. This
    paper identifies three broad privacy challenges raised by open government. The
    first is how to balance privacy with transparency and accountability in the context
    of “public” personal information. The second challenge flows from the disruption
    of traditional approaches to privacy based on a collapse of the distinctions between
    public and private sector actors. The third challenge is that of the potential
    for open government data—even if anonymized—to contribute to the big data environment
    in which citizens and their activities are increasingly monitored and profiled.

- abstract: Open data has been recognized as a valuable resource, and public institutions
    have taken to publishing their data under open licenses, also in Germany. However,
    German public transit agencies are still reluctant to publish their schedules
    as open data. Also, two widely used data exchange formats used in German transit
    planning are proprietary, with no documentation publicly available. Through this
    work, one of the proprietary formats was reverse-engineered, and a transformation
    process into the open GTFS schedule format was developed. This process allowed
    a partnering transit operator to publish their schedule as open data. Also, through
    a survey taken with German transit authorities and operators, the prevalence of
    transit data exchange formats, and reservations concerning open transit data were
    evaluated. The survey brought a series of issues to light which serve as obstacles
    for opening up transit data. Addressing the issues found through this work, and
    partnering with open-minded transit authorities to further develop transit data
    publishing processes can serve as a foundation for wider adoption of publishing
    open transit data in Germany.

- abstract: 'In the last 15 years, European countries have invested considerable resources
    to provide e-government services. Despite of its increasing availability, its
    level of adoption has not been satisfying. On the other hand, over the last years,
    coinciding with the web 2.0 trend, the e-government services co-produced by citizens
    start to appear, often without the support, acknowledgement and even awareness
    of the government. This trend stems from a well-established tradition of offline
    co- production of public services, i.e. services provided by the voluntary sector,
    but brought to an unprecedented scale thanks to the advent of web 2.0. Still,
    the concept remains not well-defined and its impact is not yet well studied. The
    paper explores on a limited sets of cases what does it mean to collaboratively
    deliver online public services; what are the success factors based on the cases
    under study and what are the incentives for service providers (other than public
    administration), citizens as users and public administration. The authors propose
    an ostensive definition of the collaborative delivery of public services: collaborative
    public services are created and run by government, civil society or by private
    sector building on the re-use of government data or citizens data. Those services
    are focused on public goods delivery (e.g. health, education, public transport)
    and are meant to change the traditional government services by engaging in an
    open dialogue with public administration about the best way to deliver those services.
    The analysis of six case studies of innovative collaborative online public services
    suggests that the online collaborative public service delivery increases its quality
    with the users׳ growth contrary to the traditional offline service delivery. The
    study results indicate that the current developers interest lies in delivering
    complementary services to the government run services rather than substitutive
    services. The authors propose also the initial list of success factors, enabling
    conditions, and benefits for all main stakeholders (users, innovators and public
    administration).'

    major stakeholders in the UK. The conceptualization is based on a review of popular
    Open Data definitions and business ecosystem theories, which we applied to empirical
    data using a timeline analysis. Our work is informed by a combination of discourse
    analysis and in-depth interviews, undertaken during the summer of 2013. Drawing
    on the UK as a best practice example, we identify a set of structural business
    ecosystem properties: circular flow of resources, sustainability, demand that
    encourages supply, and dependence developing between suppliers, intermediaries,
    and users. However, significant gaps and shortcomings are found to remain. Most
    prominently, demand is not yet fully encouraging supply and actors have yet to
    experience fully mutual interdependence.'

- abstract: 'Due to expected benefits such as citizen participation and innovation,
    the release of Public Sector Information as open data is getting increased attention
    on various levels of government. However, currently data release by governments
    is still novel and there is little experience and knowledge thus far about its
    benefits, costs and barriers. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about
    how internal processes influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get
    a better understanding of these processes and how they influence data release,
    i.e., to find determinants for the release of public sector information. For this
    purpose, we conducted workshops, interviews, questionnaires, desk research and
    practice based cases in the education program of our university, involving six
    local public sector organizations. We find that the way data is stored, the way
    data is obtained and the way data is used by a department are crucial indicators
    for open data release. We conclude with the lessons learned based on our research
    findings. These findings are: we should take a nuanced approach towards data release,
    avoid releasing data for its own sake, and take small incremental steps to explore
    data release.'

- abstract: We study innovation contests with asymmetric information and identical
    contestants, where contestants’ efforts and innate abilities generate inventions
    of varying qualities. The designer offers a reward to the contestant achieving
    the highest quality and receives the revenue generated by the innovation. We characterize
    the equilibrium behavior, outcomes and payoffs for both nondiscriminatory and
    discriminatory (where the reward is contestant-dependent) contests. We derive
    conditions under which the designer obtains a larger payoff when using a discriminatory
    contest and describe settings where these conditions are satisfied.

- abstract: Given the pace of discovery in medicine, accessing the literature to make
    informed decisions at the point of care has become increasingly difficult. Although
    the Internet creates unprecedented access to information, gaps in the medical
    literature and inefficient searches often leave healthcare providers' questions
    unanswered. Advances in social computation and human computer interactions offer
    a potential solution to this problem. We developed and piloted the mobile application
    DocCHIRP, which uses a system of point-to-multipoint push notifications designed
    to help providers problem solve by crowdsourcing from their peers. Over the 244-day
    pilot period, 85 registered users logged 1544 page views and sent 45 consult questions.
    The median initial first response from the crowd occurred within 19 minutes. Review
    of the transcripts revealed several dominant themes, including complex medical
    decision making and inquiries related to prescription medication use. Feedback
    from the post-trial survey identified potential hurdles related to medical crowdsourcing,
    including a reluctance to expose personal knowledge gaps and the potential risk
    for “distracted doctoring.” Users also suggested program modifications that could
    support future adoption, including changes to the mobile interface and mechanisms
    that could expand the crowd of participating healthcare providers.Journal of Hospital

- abstract: This paper presents a benchmark proposal for the Open Government and its
    application from the open data perspective using data available on the U.S. government's
    open data portal (data.gov). The benchmark is developed over the adopted Open
    Government conceptual model, which describes Open Government through data openness,
    transparency, participation and collaboration. Resulting in two measures, that
    is, one known as the e-government openness index (eGovOI) and the other Maturity,
    the benchmark indicates the progress of government over time, the efficiency of
    recognizing and implementing new concepts and the willingness of the government
    to recognize and embrace innovative ideas.

- abstract: We describe Quizz, a gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously
    assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them. Quizz operates
    by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a user answers
    the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the user's competence. To acquire new knowledge,
    Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not have a known answer; the
    answers given by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct
    answers for these questions. Quizz actively tries to identify knowledgeable users
    on the Internet by running advertising campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting
    capabilities of existing, publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies
    the contributions of the users using information theory and sends feedback to
    the advertising system about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting mechanism
    to further optimize ad placement. Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand
    users, confirm that we can crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized
    topics, as the advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired
    expertise and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that
    examine the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for
    having short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute.
    Finally, our cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is
    below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while offering
    the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential users all over
    the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized expertise that is not
    typically available through existing labor marketplaces.

- abstract: Social media enable promising new approaches to measuring economic activity
    and analyzing economic behavior at high frequency and in real time using information
    independent from standard survey and administrative sources. This paper uses data
    from Twitter to create indexes of job loss, job search, and job posting. Signals
    are derived by counting job-related phrases in Tweets such as "lost my job." The
    social media indexes are constructed from the principal components of these signals.
    The University of Michigan Social Media Job Loss Index tracks initial claims for
    unemployment insurance at medium and high frequencies and predicts 15 to 20 percent
    of the variance of the prediction error of the consensus forecast for initial
    claims. The social media indexes provide real-time indicators of events such as
    Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 government shutdown. Comparing the job loss index
    with the search and posting indexes indicates that the Beveridge Curve has been
    shifting inward since 2011.

- abstract: With the advent of open data initiatives, raw data has been staged as
    a crucial element of government transparency. If the consequences of such data-driven
    transparency have already been discussed, we still don’t know much about its back
    rooms. What does it mean for an administration to open its data? Following information
    infrastructure studies, this communication aims to question the modes of existence
    of raw data in administrations. Drawing on an ethnography of open government data
    projects in several French administrations, it shows that data are not ready-at-hand
    resources. Indeed, three kinds of operations are conducted that progressively
    instantiate open data. The first one is exploration. Where are, and what are,
    the data within the institution are tough questions, the response to which entails
    organizational and technical inquiries. The second one is extraction. Data are
    encapsulated in databases and its release implies a sometimes complex disarticulation
    process. The third kind of operations is ‘rawification’. It consists in a series
    of tasks that transforms what used to be indexical professional data into raw
    data. To become opened, data are (re)formatted, cleaned, ungrounded. Though largely
    invisible, these operations foreground specific ‘frictions’ that emerge during
    the sociotechnical shaping of transparency, even before data publication and reuses.

- abstract: For public sector organizations across the world, the pressures for improved
    efficiency during the past decades are now accompanied by an equally strong need
    to revolutionise service delivery to create solutions that better meet citizens’
    needs; to develop channels that offer efficiency and increase inclusion to all
    citizens being served; and to re-invent supply chains to deliver services faster,
    cheaper, and more effectively. But how do government organisations ensure investment
    in digital transformation delivers the intended outcomes after earlier “online
    government” and “e-government” initiatives produced little in terms of significant,
    sustainable benefits? Here we focus on how digitisation, built on open standards,
    is transforming the public sector’s relationship with its citizens. This paper
    provides a perspective of digital change efforts across the UK government as an
    illustration of the improvements taking place more broadly in the public sector.
    It provides a vision for the future of our digital world, revealing the symbiotic
    relationship between organisational change and digitisation, and offering insights
    into public service delivery in the digital economy

- abstract: Collective intelligence is much talked about but remains very underdeveloped
    as a field. There are small pockets in computer science and psychology and fragments
    in other fields, ranging from economics to biology. New networks and social media
    also provide a rich source of emerging evidence. However, there are surprisingly
    few useable theories, and many of the fashionable claims have not stood up to
    scrutiny. The field of analysis should be how intelligence is organised at large
    scale—in organisations, cities, nations and networks. The paper sets out some
    of the potential theoretical building blocks, suggests an experimental and research
    agenda, shows how it could be analysed within an organisation or business sector
    and points to the possible intellectual barriers to progress.

- abstract: 'Much has been said about the appeal of digital government devices to
    enhance consultation on rulemaking. This paper explores the most ambitious attempt
    by the UK central government so far to draw on “crowdsourcing” to consult and
    act on regulatory reform, the “Red Tape Challenge.” We find that the results of
    this exercise do not represent any major change to traditional challenges to consultation
    processes. Instead, we suggest that the extensive institutional arrangements for
    crowdsourcing were hardly significant in informing actual policy responses: neither
    the tone of the crowdsourced comments, the direction of the majority views, nor
    specific comments were seen to matter. Instead, it was processes within the executive
    that shaped the overall governmental responses to this initiative. The findings,
    therefore, provoke wider debates about the use of social media in rulemaking and
    consultation exercises.'

- abstract: This article draws on a case study of organisation–citizen engagement
    during railway infrastructure planning in southwest France, to examine the nature
    of participatory democracy, both conceptually—as elucidated by Habermas and others—and
    empirically, as recently practised within the framework of a model established
    in one democratically governed country. We analyse roles played by the state organisation
    responsible for building railway infrastructure; the National Commission for Public
    Debate; and the Garants, who oversee and facilitate the participatory process
    as laid down by the French law of Public Debate. We conclude by arguing that despite
    its normative aspects and its lack of provision for analysis of power relations,
    Habermas’s theory of communicative action can be used to evaluate the quality
    of organisation–citizen engagement, potentially providing a basis for informing
    actual models of democratic participation.

    We find strong correlations between these characteristics and national culture

- abstract: 'Crowdsourcing is an emerging technology where innovation and production
    are sourced out to the public through an open call. At the center of crowdsourcing
    is a resource allocation problem: there is an abundance of workers but a scarcity
    of high skills, and an easy task assigned to a high-skill worker is a waste of
    resources. This problem is complicated by the fact that the exact difficulties
    of innovation tasks may not be known in advance, so tasks that require high-skill
    labor cannot be identified and allocated ahead of time. We show that the solution
    to this problem takes the form of a skill hierarchy, where tasks are first attempted
    by low-skill labor, and high skill workers only engage with a task if less skilled
    workers are unable to finish it. This hierarchy can be constructed and implemented
    in a decentralized manner even though neither the difficulties of the tasks nor
    the skills of the candidate workers are known. We provide a dynamic pricing mechanism
    that achieves this implementation by inducing workers to self-select into different
    layers. The mechanism is simple: each time a task is attempted and not finished,
    its price (reward upon completion) goes up.'

- abstract: The Open Data movement has mainly been a data provision movement. The
    release of Open Data is usually motivated by (i) government transparency (citizen
    access to government data), (ii) the development of services by third parties
    for the benefit for citizens and companies (typically smart city approach), or
    (iii) the development of new services that stimulate the economy. The success
    of the Open Data movement and its return on investment should therefore be assessed
    among other criteria by the number and impact of the services created based on
    those data. In this paper, we study the development of services based on open
    data and means to make the data opening process more effective.

    have started adopting technical solutions to overcome this issue, typically in
    the form of middleware layers operating as ‘buses’ between data centres and the
    outside world. Open-DAI is an open source platform designed to expose data as
    services, directly pulling from legacy databases of the data holder. The platform
    is the result of an ongoing project funded under the EU ICT PSP call 2011. We
    present the rationale and features of Open-DAI, also through a comparison with
    three other open data platforms: the Socrata Open Data portal, CKAN, and ENGAGE.'

- abstract: 'This paper develops and tests a theoretical model, which assesses the
    commitment of cities to the concept of open government data (OGD), according to
    three levels. Level 1, ‘Way of life,’ reflects a high commitment to OGD; Level
    2, ‘On the Fence,’ represents either a low or erratic commitment to OGD; Level
    3, ‘Lip Service,’ refers to either scarce or no commitment to OGD. These levels
    draw on four key dimensions: 1) Rhythm; 2) Span of Issues; 3) Disclosure; and
    4) Feedback. We empirically examine this theoretical framework using longitudinal
    mixed-method analysis of the OGD behavior of 16 US cities for a period of four
    years, using a large novel corpus of municipal OGD metadata, as well as primary
    qualitative and secondary quantitative indicators. This methodology allows us
    to represent, for the first time, the evolving OGD commitment — or “OGD heart
    beat” — of cities.'

- abstract: By subsidizing the costs of civic participation, the use of the Internet
    use is believed to stimulate participation but there are fears that intensive
    Internet use causes withdrawal from public life. This paper investigates the connection
    between the way individuals participate online and offline in authoritarian, low-income
    regimes, and the nature of eParticipation among citizens in authoritarian regimes
    such as Uganda. Based on personal interviews with 116 Internet users, the study
    found that common drivers of eParticipation, such as low cost, security and anonymity
    are hard to transplant into the offline world for citizens of authoritarian states
    such as Uganda. Perceived risks of retribution and intimidation for expressing
    a particular opinion or supporting a political cause mean that citizen-to-citizen
    participation is the predominant form but still at low levels, while citizen-to-government
    participation is negligible.

- abstract: This article presents an analysis of participation patterns in an Alternate
    Reality Game, World Without Oil. This game aims to bring people together in an
    online environment to reflect on how an oil crisis might affect their lives and
    communities as a way to both counter such a crisis and to build collective intelligence
    about responding to it. We present a series of participation profiles based on
    a quantitative analysis of 1554 contributions to the game narrative made by 322
    players. We further qualitatively analyze a sample of these contributions. We
    outline the dominant themes, the majority of which engage the global oil crisis
    for its effects on commute options and present micro-sustainability solutions
    in response. We further draw on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of this
    space to discuss how the design of the game, specifically its framing of the problem,
    feedback mechanism, and absence of subject-matter expertise, counter its aim of
    generating collective intelligence, making it conducive to groupthink.

- abstract: Crowdsourcing offers unprecedented potential for solving tasks efficiently
    by tapping into the skills of large groups of people. A salient feature of crowdsourcing---its
    openness of entry---makes it vulnerable to malicious behavior. Such behavior took
    place in a number of recent popular crowdsourcing competitions. We provide game-theoretic
    analysis of a fundamental tradeoff between the potential for increased productivity
    and the possibility of being set back by malicious behavior. Our results show
    that in crowdsourcing competitions malicious behavior is the norm, not the anomaly---a
    result contrary to the conventional wisdom in the area. Counterintuitively, making
    the attacks more costly does not deter them but leads to a less desirable outcome.
    These findings have cautionary implications for the design of crowdsourcing competitions.

- abstract: The global landscape in the supply, co-creation and use of geospatial
    data is changing very rapidly with new satellites, sensors and mobile devices
    reconfiguring the traditional lines of demand and supply and the number of actors
    involved. In this paper we chart some of these technology-led developments and
    then focus on the opportunities they have created for the increased participation
    of the public in generating and contributing information for a wide range of uses,
    scientific and non. Not all this information is open or geospatial, but sufficiently
    large portions of it are to make it one of the most significant phenomena of the
    last decade. In fact, we argue that while satellite and sensors have exponentially
    increased the volumes of geospatial information available, the participation of
    the public is transformative because it expands the range of participants and
    stakeholders in society using and producing geospatial information, with opportunities
    for more direct participation in science, politics and social action.

    constructed via collective intelligence? Do the costs of acquiring, storing, displaying

    information shape those differences? We evaluate these questions empirically by
    examining slanted

    and biased phrases in content on US political issues from two sources—Encyclopædia
    Britannica

    and Wikipedia. Our overall slant measure is less (more) than zero when an article
    leans towards

    Democrat (Republican) viewpoints, while bias is the absolute value of the slant.
    Using a matched

    sample of pairs of articles from Britannica and Wikipedia, we show that, overall,
    Wikipedia articles

    are more slanted towards Democrat than Britannica articles, as well as more biased.
    Slanted

    Wikipedia articles tend to become less biased than Britannica articles on the
    same topic as they

    become substantially revised, and the bias on a per word basis hardly differs
    between the sources.

    These results have implications for the segregation of readers in online sources

- abstract: When like-minded people discuss with each other, i.e. engage in ‘enclave
    deliberation’, their opinions tend to become more extreme. This is called group
    polarization. A population-based experiment with a pre-test post-test design was
    conducted to analyze whether the norms and procedures of deliberation interfere
    with the mechanisms of group polarization. Based on a survey, people with either
    permissive or restrictive attitudes toward immigration were first identified and
    then invited to the experiment. The participants were randomly assigned to like-minded
    and mixed small-n groups. Each like-minded group consisted of only permissive
    or restrictive participants, whereas each mixed group consisted of four permissive
    and four restrictive participants. The like-minded treatment represents enclave
    deliberation, and the mixed treatment a ‘standard’ deliberative mini-public design.
    The main finding of our experiment is that people with anti-immigrant attitudes
    become more tolerant even when they deliberate in like-minded groups. Moreover,
    similar learning curves are observed in both treatments. Based on the results,
    we conclude that deliberative norms can alleviate the negative consequences of
    discussion in like-minded groups.

- abstract: "Scholars know relatively little about why law enforcement agencies choose\
    \ to share information with the public. Empirical research has shown that departments\
    \ often do so to satisfy an external demand, whether in the form of a statute\
    \ requiring information to be collected and disseminated, the presence of a consent\

- abstract: This article examines whether there is gender segmentation in civic participation
    in Latin America, and whether such segmentation is related to gender differences
    in political participation. Confirming the findings of other studies, this analysis
    indicates that there is gender segmentation in civic associational activities,
    and that men are more involved than women in political activities, except for
    voting. Among those involved in civic activities, however, women attend meetings
    more often than men or about equally in all types of activities under consideration,
    except for sports and recreational pursuits. This highlights the need to differentiate
    between type and intensity of civic participation and provides empirical evidence
    that Latin American women have strong community ties through a variety of organizations.
    The regression analysis shows that civic engagement has a positive effect on political
    participation but that the magnitude of that effect varies by gender depending
    on the activity.

- abstract: A growing range of public, private and civic organisations, from Unicef
    through Nesta to Tesco, now run units known as ‘innovation labs’. The hopeful
    assumption they share is that labs, by building on openness among other features,
    can generate promising solutions to grand challenges of the future. Despite their
    seeming proliferation and popularisation, the underlying innovation paradigm embodied
    by labs has so far received scant academic attention. This is a missed opportunity,
    because innovation labs are potentially fruitful vehicles for leveraging openness
    for radical innovation. Indeed, they not only strive to span organisational, sectoral
    and geographical boundaries by bringing a variety of uncommon actors together
    to embrace radical ideas and out-of-the box thinking, but they also aim to apply
    the concept of openness throughout the innovation process, including the experimentation
    and development phases. While the phenomenon of labs clearly forms part of a broader
    trend towards openness, it seems to transcend traditional conceptualisations of
    open innovation (Chesbrough, 2006), open strategy (Whittington et al., 2011),
    open science (David, 1998) or open government (Janssen et al., 2012). What are
    innovation labs about, how do they differ from other innovation efforts and how
    do they embrace openness to create breakthrough innovations? This short exploratory
    paper is an introduction to a larger empirical study aiming to answer these questions.

- abstract: 'Background: Wikis may give clinician communities the opportunity to build
    knowledge relevant to their practice. The only previous study reviewing a set
    of health-related wikis, without specification of purpose or audience, globally
    showed a poor reliability.

    Objective: Our aim was to review medical wiki websites dedicated to clinical practices.

    Methods: We used Google in ten languages, PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, and Web of Science
    to identify websites. The review included wiki sites, accessible and operating,
    having a topic relevant for clinical medicine, targeting physicians or medical
    students. Wikis were described according to their purposes, platform, management,
    information framework, contributions, content, and activity. Purposes were classified
    as “encyclopedic” or “non-encyclopedic”. The information framework quality was
    assessed based on the Health On the Net (HONcode) principles for collaborative
    websites, with additional criteria related to users’ transparency and editorial
    policy. From a sample of five articles per wikis, we assessed the readability
    using the Flesch test and compared articles according to the wikis’ main purpose.
    Annual editorial activities were estimated using the Google engine.

    Results: Among 25 wikis included, 11 aimed at building an encyclopedia, five a
    textbook, three lessons, two oncology protocols, one a single article, and three
    at reporting clinical cases. Sixteen wikis were specialized with specific themes
    or disciplines. Fifteen wikis were using MediaWiki software as-is, three were
    hosted by online wiki farms, and seven were purpose-built. Except for one MediaWiki-based
    site, only purpose-built platforms managed detailed user disclosures. The owners
    were ten organizations, six individuals, four private companies, two universities,
    two scientific societies, and one unknown. Among 21 open communities, 10 required
    users’ credentials to give editing rights. The median information framework quality
    score was 6 out of 16 (range 0-15). Beyond this score, only one wiki had standardized
    peer-reviews. Physicians contributed to 22 wikis, medical learners to nine, and
    lay persons to four. Among 116 sampled articles, those from encyclopedic wikis
    had more videos, pictures, and external resources, whereas others had more posology
    details and better readability. The median creation year was 2007 (1997-2011),
    the median number of content pages was 620.5 (3-98,039), the median of revisions
    per article was 17.7 (3.6-180.5) and 0.015 of talk pages per article (0-0.42).
    Five wikis were particularly active, whereas six were declining. Two wikis have
    been discontinued after the completion of the study.

    Conclusions: The 25 medical wikis we studied present various limitations in their
    format, management, and collaborative features. Professional medical wikis may
    be improved by using clinical cases, developing more detailed transparency and
    editorial policies, and involving postgraduate and continuing medical education
    learners.'

- abstract: This research examines the conditions under which Chinese central government
    ministries and provincial governments implement online consultation, a prominent
    instrument of governance reform in which officials provide interested parties
    with opportunities to offer feedback on proposed public policies. The research
    assembles original data regarding the online consultation practices of more than
    one hundred central government ministries and provincial governments. The analysis
    demonstrates that online consultation practices are more developed in provincial
    governments than central government ministries. Across organizational contexts,
    online consultation is more advanced in the disclosure of proposed policies than
    in the circulation of feedback submitted in response to draft laws and regulations.
    Finally, online consultation is primarily utilized by organizations with substantial
    resources, as well as organizations operating in environments not characterized
    by fundamental political sensitivities. These results are consistent with the
    expectation that although online consultation increases information disclosure
    and public participation in government decision making, such reforms are indicative
    not of the end of authoritarianism but rather the resilience of the Chinese Communist
    Party.

- abstract: 'This study examines participatory budgeting (PB) as an important kind
    of citizen participation in the Dominican Republic (DR) and the implications of
    this recent practice for agency, democracy, and development. PB is a process that
    intends to drive change with specific outcomes: through deliberative decision-making,
    ordinary citizens select well-being- and agency-enhancing projects that ideally
    lead to more local and authentic development. Together with the attainment of
    these tangible outcomes, valuable subjective states may also come about: people
    feel more in charge of their own lives, community groups become more collaborative
    and cooperative, and more and better democracy is fostered. Taking a step forward
    from previous studies that only focus on PB from an urban planning or public finance
    perspective, the overall objective of this study is to provide a deeper understanding
    and assessment of how PB works in the localities under analysis, its association
    with different measures of agency, the characteristics that drive its success
    or failure, and its general impact on the lives of individuals and communities.
    Drawing on normative and policy-based literatures and specifically following an
    agency-oriented capability approach, this study uses a mixed-methods approach
    to analyze interview, survey, and direct observations of PB public assemblies,
    and archival data with respect to the 2013 budget cycle in four DR municipalities.
    A regression analysis finds that participation in and awareness of PB are both
    significantly correlated with individuals reporting higher levels of individual
    and collective agency when compared to non-participants and unaware individuals.
    These measures of agency are contextualized to the municipal budget-planning cycle.
    A process tracing analysis concludes that PB is likely, under certain conditions,
    to increase democratic participation and deliberation. However, due to certain
    democratic deficits, PB in two DR municipalities does not always increase agency,
    group cooperative functioning, and good development. Thus, PB must be analyzed
    on a case-by-case basis because differences in the characteristics of each PB
    assembly may lead to different outcomes. It is finally argued that rather than
    condemning democracy because of the failures of the current PB system, we should
    advance PB''s democracy further by improving it in various ways.'

- abstract: Citizen science has seen enormous growth in recent years, in part due
    to the influence of the Internet, and a corresponding growth in interest. However,
    the few stand-out examples that have received attention from media and researchers
    are not representative of the diversity of the field as a whole, and therefore
    may not be the best models for those seeking to study or start a citizen science
    project. In this work, we present the results of a survey of citizen science project
    leaders, identifying sub-groups of project types according to a variety of features
    related to project design and management, including funding sources, goals, participant
    activities, data quality processes, and social interaction. These combined features
    highlight the diversity of citizen science, providing an overview of the breadth
    of the phenomenon and laying a foundation for comparison between citizen science
    projects and to other online communities.

- abstract: This article examines the changing nature of the connection between citizens,
    party members and elites in the creation of party policy through the theoretical
    prism of individualisation. Using qualitative case studies of recent policy-making
    initiatives in the Australian Labor Party and the UK Labour Party, the article
    develops a new model of policy transferal that is not built upon the mass-party
    model of parliamentary politics, but rather upon organisational evolutions such
    as community consultations, online participation and supporters' networks. These
    evolutions, or reforms, typically emphasise the individuality of policy-making
    and accountability, promote new technologies for facilitating decision-making,
    and attempt to engage with a new style of politically active citizen. Each of
    these developments carries implications for how political parties facilitate participation,
    accountability and responsiveness in modern forms of representative democracy.

- abstract: Open Data (OD) programs have become popular. OD proponents argue that
    OD  programs are necessary to reinvigorate participatory democracy and active
    citizenship. However, the debate between proponents and critics of these programs
    relies on anecdotal data. The paper describes a methodological innovation (dubbed
    “The Public Sector Information Exchange (PSIE)”) to automatically capture, process,
    store, and analyze metadata information about the Open Data (OD) information assets  published
    by government agencies at any level of government (e.g., federal, national, regional,
    municipal) worldwide. The analysis of the initial PSIE data (currently only about
    some datasets published by U.S. federal agencies) supports the argument that OD
    programs have become the playground of a small number of agencies and that many
    OD information assets are either incomprehensible or impossible to find. The concluding
    section of the paper discusses how to incentivize agencies to improve cooperation
    with OD programs.

- abstract: We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of EMBERS, an automated,
    24x7 continuous system for forecasting civil unrest across 10 countries of Latin
    America using open source indicators such as tweets, news sources, blogs, economic
    indicators, and other data sources. Unlike retrospective studies, EMBERS has been
    making forecasts into the future since Nov 2012 which have been (and continue
    to be) evaluated by an independent T&E team (MITRE). Of note, EMBERS has successfully
    forecast the uptick and downtick of incidents during the June 2013 protests in
    Brazil. We outline the system architecture of EMBERS, individual models that leverage
    specific data sources, and a fusion and suppression engine that supports trading
    off specific evaluation criteria. EMBERS also provides an audit trail interface
    that enables the investigation of why specific predictions were made along with
    the data utilized for forecasting. Through numerous evaluations, we demonstrate
    the superiority of EMBERS over baserate methods and its capability to forecast
    significant societal happenings.

- abstract: 'In recent years we have witnessed a shift in the innovation landscape
    of organizations from closed to more open models embracing solutions from the
    outside. Widespread use of the internet and web 2.0 technologies have made it
    easier for organizations to connect with their clients, service providers, and
    the public at large for more collaborative problem solving and innovation. Introduction
    of the Open Government initiative accompanied by the America Competes Reauthorization
    Act signaled an unprecedented commitment by the US Federal Government to stimulating
    more innovation and creativity in problem solving. The policy and legislation
    empowered agencies to open up their problem solving space beyond their regular
    pool of contractors in finding solutions to the nation''s most complex problems.


    This is an exploratory study of the adoption of challenges as an organizational
    innovation in public sector organizations. The main objective is to understand
    and explain how, and under what conditions challenges are being used by federal
    agencies and departments as a tool to promote innovation. The organizational innovation
    literature provides the main theoretical foundation for this study, but does not
    directly address contextual aspects regarding the type of innovation and the type
    of organization. The guiding framework uses concepts drawn from three literature
    streams: organizational innovation, open innovation, and public sector innovation.


    Research was conducted using a qualitative case study of challenge.gov. Data was
    collected from multiple adopting agencies using two primary sources: interviews
    with challenge managers and administrators and, archival data from the challenge.gov
    web platform. Related documentation was used to supplement and corroborate the
    main data. Analysis of the platform archival data revealed four types of challenges
    falling along a continuum of increasing innovation. The sequence of events, activities
    and conditions leading to adoption and implementation were represented as a challenge
    adoption model. Variations among components of the model resulted in three distinct
    agency groupings represented as a typology of enactments characterized as inertia,
    application, and change. Thus challenge adoption among agencies with varying missions,
    operations and conditions leads to varying enactment types and different levels
    of change.'

- abstract: 'Under what circumstances do new constitutions promote democracy? Between
    1974 and 2011,

    the level of democracy increased in 62 countries following the adoption of a new
    constitution,

    but decreased or stayed the same in 70 others. Using data covering all 138 new
    constitutions in

    118 countries during that period, we explain this divergence through empirical
    tests showing

    that overall increased participation during the process of making the constitution
    positively

    impacts post-promulgation levels of democracy. Then, after disaggregating constitution
    making

    into three stages (drafting, debating, and ratification) we find compelling evidence
    through

    robust statistical tests that the degree of citizen participation in the drafting
    stage has a much

    greater impact on the resulting regime. This lends support to some core principles
    of

    “deliberative” theories of democracy. We conclude that constitutional reformers
    should focus

    more on generating public “buy in” at the front end of the constitution-making
    process, rather

    than concentrating on ratification and referendums at the “back end” that are
    unlikely to correct

    for an “original sin” of limited citizen deliberation during drafting.'

- abstract: This article examines citizen science projects, defined as “a form of
    open collaboration where members of the public participate in the scientific process,
    including identifying research questions, collecting and analyzing the data, interpreting
    the results, and problem solving,” as an effective and innovative tool for National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) science in line with the Obama Administration's
    Open Government Directive. Citizen science projects allow volunteers with no technical
    training to participate in analysis of large sets of data that would otherwise
    constitute prohibitively tedious and lengthy work for research scientists. Zooniverse.com
    hosts a multitude of popular space-focused citizen science projects, many of which
    have been extraordinarily successful and have enabled new research publications
    and major discoveries. This article takes a multifaceted look at such projects
    by examining the benefits of citizen science, effective game design, and current
    desktop computer and mobile device usage trends. It offers suggestions of potential
    research topics to be studied with emerging technologies, policy considerations,
    and opportunities for outreach. This analysis includes an overview of other crowdsourced
    research methods such as distributed computing and contests. New research and
    data analysis of mobile phone usage, scientific curiosity, and political engagement
    among Zooniverse.com project participants has been conducted for this study.

- abstract: 'This report tells the stories of cities around the world - from Beijing
    to Amsterdam, and from London to Jakarta - that are addressing urban challenges
    by using digital technologies to engage and enable citizens.


    Key findings


    Many ‘top down’ smart city ideas have failed to deliver on their promise, combining
    high costs and low returns.

    ‘Collaborative technologies’ offer cities another way to make smarter use of resources,
    smarter ways of collecting data and smarter ways to make decisions.

    Collaborative technologies can also help citizens themselves shape the future
    of their cities.

    We have created five recommendations for city government who want to make their
    cities smarter.

    As cities bring people together to live, work and play, they amplify their ability
    to create wealth and ideas. But scale and density also bring acute challenges:
    how to move around people and things; how to provide energy; how to keep people
    safe.


    ‘Smart cities’ offer sensors, ‘big data’ and advanced computing as answers to
    these challenges, but they have often faced criticism for being too concerned
    with hardware rather than with people.


    In this report we argue that successful smart cities of the future will combine
    the best aspects of technology infrastructure while making the most of the growing
    potential of ''collaborative technologies'', technologies that enable greater
    collaboration between urban communities and between citizens and city governments.


    How will this work in practice? Drawing on examples from all around the world
    we investigate four emerging methods which are helping city governments engage
    and enable citizens: the collaborative economy, crowdsourcing data, collective
    intelligence and crowdfunding.


    Policy recommendations


    Set up a civic innovation lab to drive innovation in collaborative technologies.

    Use open data and open platforms to mobilise collective knowledge.

    Take human behaviour as seriously as technology.

    Invest in smart people, not just smart technology.

    Spread the potential of collaborative technologies to all parts of society.

- abstract: 'This report examines patient organisations’ ever more critical role as
    knowledge brokers in an increasingly complex, data-rich healthcare system.

    Key findings


    Patient organisations are important examples of collective intelligence practiced
    in challenging conditions with the aim of tackling complex problems.

    With more long term conditions and multimorbidities, more data, more available
    options in diagnostics, treatments, and care, knowledge is becoming one of the
    most critical assets of patients seeking optimal care.

    Patient organisations, working as collectives, are in an excellent position to
    support the work of translating, assembling and analysing the information involved
    in healthcare.

    Innovative patient organisations are already supporting the development of peer
    relationships, driving ambitious research programmes, sharing skills and unlocking
    the energy and expertise of patients. But they need support from better tools
    to extend this critical work.

    Unlike many popular examples of collective intelligence such as open source software,
    people coming to patient organisations are not motivated by pre-existing technical
    skills, but by urgent personal needs. This makes them a hugely productive site
    of research.


    The ‘thinking challenges’ patients face are enormous and complex, involving an
    ever-growing store of medical information, the practical and bureaucratic skills
    of living with a condition. Many go beyond adherence to understanding and partaking
    in research.


    The health care system is under strain from increasing demand and resource pressure.
    The NHS and other healthcare networks have committed to engage and empower patients
    and support them in developing expertise, enabling them to take a more active
    role in their own care. But knowledge tools and systems that engage only with
    individuals tend to exacerbate existing health care divides. Health knowledge
    work is hard, and requires time and resources.


    In this report we argue that patient organisations have a pivotal role to play
    in distributing the burden and benefit of knowledge work amongst participants.
    They need new and better tools to support their work developing connections between
    the many individuals and institutions of the healthcare system, driving ambitious
    research programmes, and facilitating peer support.

- abstract: 'The valuation of multiple ecosystem services requires the design of valuation
    processes able to integrate different dimensions of value and to cope with complexity.
    Following the “value-articulating institution” framework, we note that three core
    problems arise: the cognitive, normative and composition problems. Combining valuation
    methods, such as contingent valuation and multicriteria analysis, with participatory
    and deliberative techniques is increasingly promoted as a means to address those
    fundamental problems. However, the quality and legitimacy of the valuation process
    then becomes dependent on how participation is framed. We note that numerous issues
    need to be taken into account, such as the roles assumed by participants, the
    differences in contribution among participants, the level of participatory impact
    and the level of democratization of the decision-making process. This paper proposes
    a detailed qualitative analysis of four case studies, each of them having implemented
    a specific valuation method in a participatory process. We analyze how those cases
    were handled in each of the dimensions considered and offer our conclusions about
    the added values and remaining challenges related to participatory environmental
    valuation.'

- abstract: 'This article shows how activists in the open data movement re-articulate
    notions of democracy, participation, and journalism by applying practices and
    values from open source culture to the creation and use of data. Focusing on the
    Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews
    and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new
    rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics.
    Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a
    prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source
    code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative
    monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation
    of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and
    flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of
    participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries
    are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an
    interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At
    the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic
    technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting
    that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they
    illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help
    to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors
    outside big government and big business.'

- abstract: Online deliberation may provide a more cost-effective and/or less inhibiting
    environment for public participation than face to face (F2F). But do online methods
    bias participation toward certain individuals or groups? We compare F2F versus
    online participation in an experiment affording within-participants and cross-modal
    comparisons. For English speakers required to have Internet access as a condition
    of participation, we find no negative effects of online modes on equality of participation
    (EoP) related to gender, age, or educational level. Asynchronous online discussion
    appears to improve EoP for gender relative to F2F. Data suggest a dampening effect
    of online environments on black participants, as well as amplification for whites.
    Synchronous online voice communication EoP is on par with F2F across individuals.
    But individual-level EoP is much lower in the online forum, and greater online
    forum participation predicts greater F2F participation for individuals. Measured
    rates of participation are compared to self-reported experiences, and other findings
    are discussed.

- abstract: Though much attention has been given to the relationship between contractor
    and vendor in regard to governmental accountability, little attention has been
    paid to the internal struggles that surface in regard to accountability in the
    procurement process. These informal horizontal relationships often circumvent
    vertical accountability controls most often thought to ensure equitable vendor
    selection. Similarly, though much attention has been paid to political influence
    in contracting, hierarchal organizational structures, and measures of performance,
    the contract officer-program manager relation has not been explored. Specifically,
    the informal tension that often forms between the program manager and contract
    officer has not been examined in regard to such accountability. This paper examines
    the relationship between the program officer and the contract officer in order
    to describe how hybrid public administration can affect the contracting process.

- abstract: 'The behavioral sciences have flourished by studying how traditional and/or
    rational behavior has been governed throughout most of human history by relatively
    well-informed individual and social learning. In the online age, however, social
    phenomena can occur with unprecedented scale and unpredictability, and individuals
    have access to social connections never before possible. Similarly, behavioral
    scientists now have access to“big data”sets–those from Twitter and Facebook, for
    example–that did not exist a few years ago. Studies of human dynamics based on
    these data sets are novel and exciting but, if not placed in context, can foster
    the misconception that mass-scale online behavior is all we need to understand,
    for example, how humans make decisions. To overcome that misconception, we draw
    on the field of discrete-choice theory to create a multiscale comparative “map”
    that, like a principal-components representation, captures the essence of decision
    making along two axes: (1) an east–west dimension that represents the degree to
    which an agent makes a decision independently versus one that is socially influenced,
    and(2) a north–south dimension that represents the degree to which there is transparency
    in the payoffs and risks associated with the decisions agents make. We divide
    the map into quadrants, each of which features a signature behavioral pattern.
    When taken together, the map and its signatures provide an easily understood empirical
    framework for evaluating how modern collective behavior may be changing in the
    digital age, including whether behavior is becoming more individualistic, as people
    seek outexactly what they want, or more social, as people become more inextricably
    linked, even“herdlike,” in their decision making.We believe the map will lead
    to many new testable hypotheses concerning human behavior as well as to similar
    applications throughout the social sciences.'

- abstract: 'The economic and social potential of open data is widely acknowledged.
    In particular, the business opportunities have received much attention. But for
    all the excitement, we still know very little about how and under what conditions
    open data really works.


    To broaden our understanding of the use and impact of open data, the GovLab has
    a variety of initiatives and studies underway. Today, we share publicly our findings
    on how Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are leveraging open data for
    a variety of purposes. Our paper “Open Data: A 21st Century Asset for Small and
    Medium Sized Enterprises” seeks to build a portrait of the lifecycle of open data—how
    it is collected, stored and used. It outlines some of the most important parameters
    of an open data business model for SMEs.


    The universe of SMEs we analyzed comprised those identified within the GovLab’s
    Open Data 500 project which contains data on how 500 US businesses are using open
    data in their day-to-day activities. It represents arguably the first systematic
    effort to really understand how open data can grow revenues, drive innovation,
    increase efficiency and create new jobs.


    The paper analyzes ten aspects of open data and establishes ten principles for
    its effective use by SMEs. Taken together, these offer a roadmap for any SME considering
    greater use or adoption of open data in its business.


    Among the key findings included in the paper:


    SMEs, which often lack access to data or sophisticated analytical tools to process
    large datasets, are likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries of open data.

    Government data is the main category of open data being used by SMEs. A number
    of SMEs are also using open scientific and shared corporate data.

    Open data is used primarily to serve the Business-to-Business (B2B) markets, followed
    by the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) markets. A number of the companies studied serve
    two or three market segments simultaneously.

    Open data is usually a free resource, but SMEs are monetizing their open-data-driven
    services to build viable businesses. The most common revenue models include subscription-based
    services, advertising, fees for products and services, freemium models, licensing
    fees, lead generation and philanthropic grants.

    The most significant challenges SMEs face in using open data include those concerning
    data quality and consistency, insufficient financial and human resources, and
    issues surrounding privacy.

    This is just a sampling of findings and observations. The paper includes a number
    of additional observations concerning business and revenue models, product development,
    customer acquisition, and other subjects of relevance to any company considering
    an open data strategy.

- abstract: After decades of urban investment dominated by sprawl and outward growth,
    municipal governments in the United States are responsible for the upkeep of urban
    neighborhoods that have not received sufficient resources or maintenance in many
    years. One of city governments' biggest challenges is to revitalize decaying neighborhoods
    given only limited resources. In this paper, we apply data science techniques
    to administrative data to help the City of Memphis, Tennessee improve distressed
    neighborhoods. We develop new methods to efficiently identify homes in need of
    rehabilitation and to predict the impacts of potential investments on neighborhoods.
    Our analyses allow Memphis to design neighborhood-improvement strategies that
    generate greater impacts on communities. Since our work uses data that most US
    cities already collect, our models and methods are highly portable and inexpensive
    to implement. We also discuss the challenges we encountered while analyzing government
    data and deploying our tools, and highlight important steps to improve future
    data-driven efforts in urban policy.

- abstract: The growing participation in social networking sites is altering the nature
    of social relations and changing the nature of political and public dialogue.
    This paper contributes to the current debate on Web 2.0 technologies and their
    implications for local governance, identifying the perceptions of policy makers
    on the use of Web 2.0 in providing public services and on the changing roles that
    could arise from the resulting interaction between local governments and their
    stakeholders. The results obtained suggest that policy makers are willing to implement
    Web 2.0 technologies in providing public services, but preferably under the Bureaucratic
    model framework, thus retaining a leading role in this implementation. The learning
    curve of local governments in the use of Web 2.0 technologies is a factor that
    could influence policy makers’ perceptions. In this respect, many research gaps
    are identified and further study of the question is recommended.

- abstract: A number of governments worldwide employ web-based e-consultation platforms
    to enable stakeholders commenting on draft legislation. Stakeholders’ input includes
    arguing in favour or against the proposed legislation as well as proposing alternative
    ideas. In this paper, we empirically investigate the relationship between the
    volume of contributions in these platforms and the amount of new ideas that are
    generated. This enables us to determine whether participants in such platforms
    keep generating new ideas or just recycle a finite number of ideas. We capitalised
    on argumentation models to code and analyse a large number of draft law consultations
    published in opengov.gr, the official e-consultation platform for draft legislation
    in Greece. Our results suggest that as the number of posts grows, the number of
    new ideas continues to increase. The results of this study improve our understanding
    of the dynamics of these consultations and enable us to design better platforms.

- abstract: The potential of open data as a resource for driving citizen-led urban
    innovation relies not only on a suitable technical infrastructure but also on
    the skills and knowledge of the citizens themselves. This paper describes how
    a smart city project in Milton Keynes, UK, is supporting multiple stages of citizen
    innovation, from ideation through to citizen-led smart city projects. This approach
    encounters challenges when engaging with citizens in identifying and implementing
    data-driven solutions to urban problems. The majority of citizens have little
    practical experience with the types of data sets that might be availa- ble, nor
    possess the appropriate skills for their analysis and utilisation for ad- dressing
    urban issues, or finding novel ways to hack their city. We go on to de- scribe
    the Urban Data School, which aims to offer a long-term solution to this problem
    by providing teaching resources around urban data sets aimed at rais- ing the
    standard of data literacy amongst future generations. Lesson resources that form
    part of the Urban Data School have been piloted in a primary and two secondary
    schools in Milton Keynes.

    article begins to answer this question by collecting, categorizing, and situating
    an extensive body of the extant research investigating policy crowdsourcing, within
    a new framework built on fundamental typologies from each field. We first define
    seven universal characteristics of the three general crowdsourcing techniques
    (virtual labor markets, tournament crowdsourcing, open collaboration), to examine
    the relative trade-offs of each modality. We then compare these three types of
    crowdsourcing to the different stages of the policy cycle, in order to situate
    the literature spanning both domains. We finally discuss research trends in crowdsourcing
    for public policy and highlight the research gaps and overlaps in the literature.

- abstract: Perfect anonymization of data sets has failed. But the process of protecting
    data subjects in shared information remains integral to privacy practice and policy.
    While the deidentification debate has been vigorous and productive, there is no
    clear direction for policy. As a result, the law has been slow to adapt a holistic
    approach to protecting data subjects when data sets are released to others. Currently,
    the law is focused on whether an individual can be identified within a given set.
    We argue that the better locus of data release policy is on the process of minimizing
    the risk of reidentification and sensitive attribute disclosure. Process-based
    data release policy, which resembles the law of data security, will help us move
    past the limitations of focusing on whether data sets have been “anonymized.”
    It draws upon different tactics to protect the privacy of data subjects, including
    accurate deidentification rhetoric, contracts prohibiting reidentification and
    sensitive attribute disclosure, data enclaves, and query-based strategies to match
    required protections with the level of risk. By focusing on process, data release
    policy can better balance privacy and utility where nearly all data exchanges
    carry some risk.

- abstract: 'There is a certain allure to the idea that cities allow a person to both
    feel at home and like a stranger in the same place. That one can know the streets
    and shops, avenues and alleys, while also going days without being recognized.
    But as elites fill cities with “smart” technologies — turning them into platforms
    for the “Internet of Things” (IoT): sensors and computation embedded within physical
    objects that then connect, communicate, and/or transmit information with or between
    each other through the Internet — there is little escape from a seamless web of
    surveillance and power. This paper will outline a social theory of the “smart
    city” by developing our Deleuzian concept of the “spectrum of control.” We present
    two illustrative examples: biometric surveillance as a form of monitoring, and
    automated policing as a particularly brutal and exacting form of manipulation.
    We conclude by offering normative guidelines for governance of the pervasive surveillance
    and control mechanisms that constitute an emerging critical infrastructure of
    the “smart city.”'

    nearly everyone is already carrying a high-precision sensor providing an opportunity
    to monitor and analyze the dynamics of human movement on unprecedented scales.
    In this article, we present a technique and visualization tool which uses aggregated
    activity measures of mobile networks to gain information about human activity
    shaping the structure of the cities. Based on ten months of mobile network data,
    activity patterns can be compared through time and space to unravel the "city''s
    pulse" as seen through the specific signatures of different locations. Furthermore,
    the tool allows classifying the neighborhoods into functional clusters based on
    the timeline of human activity, providing valuable insights on the actual land
    use patterns within the city. This way, the approach and the tool provide new
    ways of looking at the city structure from historical perspective and potentially
    also in real-time based on dynamic up-to-date records of human behavior. The online
    tool presents results for four global cities: New York, London, Hong Kong and
    Los Angeles.'

- abstract: We estimated ideological preferences of 3.8 million Twitter users and,
    using a data set of nearly 150 million tweets concerning 12 political and nonpolitical
    issues, explored whether online communication resembles an “echo chamber” (as
    a result of selective exposure and ideological segregation) or a “national conversation.”
    We observed that information was exchanged primarily among individuals with similar
    ideological preferences in the case of political issues (e.g., 2012 presidential
    election, 2013 government shutdown) but not many other current events (e.g., 2013
    Boston Marathon bombing, 2014 Super Bowl). Discussion of the Newtown shootings
    in 2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation before
    transforming into a polarized exchange. With respect to both political and nonpolitical
    issues, liberals were more likely than conservatives to engage in cross-ideological
    dissemination; this is an important asymmetry with respect to the structure of
    communication that is consistent with psychological theory and research bearing
    on ideological differences in epistemic, existential, and relational motivation.
    Overall, we conclude that previous work may have overestimated the degree of ideological
    segregation in social-media usage.

- abstract: 'This article takes stock of the growing field of online deliberation
    research. Our review of the theoretical and empirical findings is guided by a
    framework encompassing the three relevant components of deliberation: the institutional
    design that enables and fosters deliberation (institutional input: “design”),
    the quality of the communication process (communicative throughput: “process”),
    and the expected results of deliberation (productive outcome: “results”). Our
    findings show that scholarly attention is unevenly distributed across the different
    components of the framework. Most research has focused on the quality of the online
    discussion (process). A fair amount of research has focused on the institutional
    conditions fostering deliberation (design), while the outcomes of online deliberation
    processes (results) have mostly been neglected. This picture is repeated in terms
    of the causal relations between design, process, and results of deliberation:
    Most studies have dealt with the effects of the platform design on the degree
    of deliberation (design-process). Much less is known about how the process of
    deliberation shapes the outcomes of deliberation (process-results). Studies investigating
    all three aspects of deliberation and their causal links (design-process-results)
    are particularly rare.'

- abstract: 'The Internet is considered a huge development in human civilization.
    It is literally considered as a practical key or essential to human development
    and social advancement causing massive innovation in the world. Over the years,
    the advent of new media has permeated most aspects of our lives, especially that
    of the young generation. It is against this background that this paper aims to
    analyse the present use of the new media by youth to gauge their usage in relation
    to political participation. This study is a country wide survey covering Peninsula
    and East Malaysia. For sampling purposes the country is divided into six zones.
    A survey research using questionnaire as instrument was used to obtain data. Prior
    to the actual survey, a pilot study was first conducted. Some 1182 respondents
    age between 18 and 25 were randomly sampled from the six zones and selection of
    samples was based on ethnic ratio. The data was analysed descriptively and inferentially
    using SPSS 20.0 From the results, majority of the respondents, 89% are social
    media users having a social media account. A discouraging trend with regard to
    participation is the very low level of giving comments on general societal issues
    ranging from social issues, the environment to politics. The youth are more inclined
    to using the new media for entertainment and social networking. It is time to
    use the new media to engage with community leaders and politicians and comment
    on issues related to political issues. '

- abstract: 'To what extent is agency rulemaking democratic? This paper examines the
    soundness of and empirical support for the leading theories that purport to endow
    the administrative state with democratic legitimacy. We study the theories in
    light of two normative benchmarks: a "democratic" benchmark based on voter preferences,
    and a "republican" benchmark based on the preferences of elected representatives.
    We conclude that all of the proposed theories lack empirical support and many
    have substantial conceptual flaws; we point to directions for possible future
    research.'

- abstract: Co-production establishes an interactive relationship between citizens
    and public service providers. Successful co-production hence requires the engagement
    of citizens. Typically, individual characteristics such as age, gender, and income
    are used to explain why citizens co-produce. In contrast, neighbourhood-level
    variables receive less attention. Nevertheless, the co-production literature,
    as well as social capital and urban planning theory, provides good arguments why
    neighbourhood variables may be relevant. In this study, we examine the administrative
    records of citizen-initiated contacts in a reporting programme for problems in
    the public domain. This co-production programme is located in the district of
    Deurne in the city of Antwerp, Belgium. A multilevel analysis is used to simultaneously
    assess the impact of neighbourhood characteristics and individual variables. While
    the individual variables usually found to explain co-production are present in
    our case, we also find that neighbourhood characteristics significantly explain
    co-production. Thus, our findings suggest that participation in co-production
    activities is determined not only by who you are, but also by where you live.

- abstract: "This paper reviews evidence on the use of 23 information and communication\
    \ technology (ICT) platforms\n to project citizen voice to improve public service\
    \ delivery. This meta-analysis focuses on empirical studies\n of initiatives in\
    \ the global South, highlighting both citizen uptake (‘yelp’) and the degree to\
    \ which public\n service providers respond to expressions of citizen voice (‘teeth’).\
    \ The conceptual framework further distinguishes\n between two trajectories for\
    \ ICT-enabled citizen voice: Upwards accountability occurs when users\n provide\
    \ feedback directly to decision-makers in real time, allowing policy-makers and\
    \ program managers\n to identify and address service delivery problems – but at\
    \ their discretion. Downwards accountability, in\n contrast, occurs either through\
    \ real time user feedback or less immediate forms of collective civic action\n\
    \ that publicly call on service providers to become more accountable and depends\
    \ less exclusively on decision-\n makers’ discretion about whether or not to act\
    \ on the information provided. This distinction between\n the ways in which ICT\
    \ platforms mediate the relationship between citizens and service providers allows\
    \ for\n a precise analytical focus on how different dimensions of such platforms\
    \ contribute to public sector responsiveness.\n These cases suggest that while\
    \ ICT platforms have been relevant in increasing policymakers’\n and senior managers’\
    \ capacity to respond, most of them have yet to influence their willingness to\
    \ do so."
